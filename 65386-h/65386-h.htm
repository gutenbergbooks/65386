<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A clock struck eight, a loud yet distant clock. The
strokes, Alix thought, seemed to glide downwards
rather than to fall through the fog and tumult of the
station, and, counting them as they emerged, they
were so slow and heavy that they made her think of
tawny drones pushing their way forth from among
the thickets of hot thyme in the <span class='it'>jardin potager</span> at
Montarel. Sitting straightly in her corner of the
Victoria waiting-room, the little French girl fixed her
mind upon the picture thus evoked so that she should
not feel too sharply the alarming meaning of the hour,
and seemed again to watch the blunt, sagacious faces
of the drones as they paused in sulky deliberation on
the tip of a spray before launching themselves into
the sunlight. What could be more unlike Montarel
than this cold and paltry scene? What more unlike
that air, tranced with sunlight and silence, than this
dense atmosphere? Yet the heavy, gliding notes
brought back the drones so vividly that she found
herself again in the high-terraced garden under the
sun-baked old château. The magnolia-trees ate into
the crumbling walls and opened lemon-scented cups
beneath her as she leaned her arms on the hot stone
and looked across the visionary plains to the Alps on
the horizon, blue, impalpable, less substantial to the
sight than the clouds that sailed in grandiose snowy
fleets above them. Alix had always felt that it was
like taking great breaths to see the plains and like
spreading immense wings to see the mountains, and
something of invulnerable dignity, of inaccessible
remoteness in her demeanour as she sat there might
well have been derived from generations who had
lived and died in the presence of natural sublimities.
Her brows were contemplative, her lips proud. She
was evidently a foreigner, a creature nurtured in
climes golden yet austere and springing from an aromatic,
rocky soil. The pallor of her extreme fatigue
could not efface the sunny tones of her skin; her hair
was the blacker for its bronzed lights, and if her eyes
were blue, it was not the English blue of a water-side
forget-me-not, but the dense, impalpable blue of the
Alps seen across great distances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two women, pausing on their way out to look at
her, drew her mind back from Montarel. She knew
that she might look younger than her years. Her
bobbed hair was cut straight across her forehead and
her skirt displayed a childish length of leg. It was no
wonder that, seeing her there, alone, they should
speak of her with curiosity, perhaps with solicitude;
for there was kindness in their eyes. But she did not
like pity, and, drawing herself up more straightly,
wrapping her arms in the scarf that muffled her shoulders,
she fixed her eyes blankly above their heads
until they had passed on. They were kind women;
but very ugly. Like jugs. All the people that she had
seen since landing on this day of grey and purple
flesh-tones had made her think of the earthenware
jugs that old Marthe used to range along her upper
shelves in the little dark shop that stood on the turn
of the road leading down from the château to the
village. Their eyes were joyless yet untragic. Their
clothes expressed no enterprise. She did not think
that they could feel ecstasy, ever, or despair. Yet
they were the people of Captain Owen, and she could
not be really forgotten, for Captain Owen’s family
were to come for her. It was only some mistake; but
more than the strokes of the clock the women’s eyes
had made her feel how late it was, how young she
was, and how hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maman’s <span class='it'>déjeuner</span>, the long buttered <span class='it'>petits pains</span>
with ham in them, she had eaten on the boat; and,
far away, seen across the leaden waters of the November
channel, was the bright <span class='it'>petit déjeuner</span>, in Paris
that morning, and Maman before the wood fire, her
beauty still clouded by sleep, sweet, sombre, and gay
as only she could be, her russet locks tossed back and
her white arms bare in the white woollen <span class='it'>peignoir</span>.
“They will, I know, be good to my darling,” Maman
had said, buttering her roll while Albertine brought
in the coffee, “and keep her warm and well-fed through
this hard winter.” Firmness and resource breathed
from Maman. She knew what she was doing and Alix
saw herself powerless in her hands. Yet she could read
her, too. Even though she could not always interpret
the words, she could always read Maman, and the
meaning, as it were, of the sentence would come to her
in a feeling rather than in an idea. She had felt that
morning that Maman’s heart was not at ease. It was
true that the Armistice had been signed but the other
day, that the war was hardly over, and that everything
would be more expensive than ever. It was true
that she was going to friends, though to unknown
friends; to the family of their dear Captain Owen,
killed in battle only nine months ago. He had so often
said that they must know his family, and it had been
his mother who had written so kindly to say that
Giles would meet her. But if all this were so natural,
why had she felt that touch of artifice in Maman’s
manner, that resource in her so many reasons? Perhaps
they did not really want her. And perhaps there
was some mistake and they did not expect her to-night.
If no one came, what was she to do? She had
only five shillings in her purse. The porter had placed
her little box and her dressing-case on the seat beside
her, and if no one came was she to sit on here all night,
in the waiting-room, this horrid feeling, half hunger,
half fear, gnawing at the pit of her stomach? “<span class='it'>Dieu,
que j’ai faim!</span>” she thought; and as she now leaned
back her head and closed her eyes, the sadness that
flowed into her carried her far back to Montarel again
and it was Grand-père that she saw, passing under the
pollarded lime-trees with his dragging footsteps and
looking down on the ground as he went, with no eyes
for the climbing vineyards, no eyes for the plains, the
river, the Alps; his short white beard and jutting nose
giving him still the air of a <span class='it'>commandant</span>, high on his
fortress; but so old, so ill, so poor and so despairing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dappled shadows of the limes lay brightly blue
at his feet. His bleached hands were clasped behind
him on his stick. He wore a black silk skull-cap and a
white silk handkerchief was knotted around his neck.
It had always frightened her a little to see Grand-père,
and it frightened her now to remember him, the <span class='it'>commandant</span>,
defeated, broken; yet still with that sombre
fire smouldering in his eyes. “<span class='it'>Tout-à-fait une tête de
Port-Royal</span>,” she had heard someone say of him once;
and so a devout noble of the time of Louis Quatorze
might have looked. Only she did not see Grand-père
as appeased, withdrawn from the world and its illusions;
he brooded, rather, in bitterness upon them.
He minded everything so terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remembered as if it were yesterday the dreadful
summer afternoon when the bell had clanged hoarsely
in the courtyard, and Mélanie, wiping her steaming
arms on her apron, had come clapping in her <span class='it'>savates</span>
across the paving-stones to let in the opulent gentleman
who had arrived in his motor to take away the
Clouets. That was the day that had revealed to her
what Grand-père’s poverty must be. He had sold the
Clouets at last; after selling so many things. The
great gaunt salles, the little panelled salons, the rows of
incommodious bedrooms, looking, from high up, over
the plains, all were empty; and the Clouets now were
to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a child’s awed heart, half comprehending,
Alix had followed Mélanie and the stranger, up the
winding staircase in the turret—Mélanie took him by
that circuitous route so that Grand-père should catch
no glimpse of him; along the chill stone passages, to
the little room where she and Grand-père sat and read
in the evenings. The <span class='it'>lit de repos</span> stood there, draped
in its tattered brocades, dignified and irrelevant, for
no one ever thought of lying down on it; and Grand-père’s
old <span class='it'>bergère</span>, and her <span class='it'>tabouret</span> drawn up to the
table before her histories. And there, upon the sea-green
panelled walls, the silvery Clouets hung, Mouverays
among them; frigidly smiling in their ruffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mélanie, mute, grim, inscrutable, helped the gentleman
from Paris to take them down, one by one, and
wrap them up and carry them across the courtyard to
the waiting car: and Alix had watched it all, knowing
that a final disaster had fallen upon her house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But poverty had not been the only reason for Grand-père’s
bitterness. Even when he sat to watch her and
Marie-Jeanne, his hands folded on his stick, quiet and
at peace in the evening air as it might have seemed,
she was aware of the bitterness brooding there, unappeased,
at the bottom of the deep, considering look
bent upon them. There had been no time to think
about it while she played with Marie-Jeanne. Marie-Jeanne
was the blacksmith’s daughter and there had
been many happy days with her at Montarel. Marie-Jeanne
had black eyes and her pig-tails were tied together
with red tape and plaited so tightly that they
surrounded her shrewd little face with a wiry circle.
They brought up a family of dolls in a corner of the
<span class='it'>jardin potager</span>; Alix was the father, for she had never
cared fosteringly for dolls, and Marie-Jeanne the
mother. They whipped their tops in the courtyard
where the tall blue lilies stood in the damp about the
well. The Renaissance wrought-iron windlass was all
rusted and broken; and the lilies had thrust their cord-like
roots through the cracked earthenware of their
great pots. Looking out of the door in the courtyard,
one might see the cheerful <span class='it'>matelassière</span> sitting in the
shade of the enormous horse-chestnut-tree on the
wayside grass. The heaped wool seemed to curdle and
foam about her like a turbulent yet cosy sea. She
combed it out on her loom and smiled and nodded at
Alix. “<span class='it'>Bonjour, la jolie petite demoiselle</span>,” she would
say. Mélanie grumbled at the <span class='it'>matelassière</span> and said
she was a thief; but she gave Alix a bowl of <span class='it'>café au
lait</span> to carry out to her when she remade their mattresses,
and Alix felt a pleasing sense of complicity in
lawlessness when the <span class='it'>matelassière</span>, bending her lips to
the steaming coffee, would close one eye at her in a
long wink. She seemed a very happy person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road led down to the village, stony, steep, and
golden with the vineyards on either hand. The little
houses were washed with pink and fawn and cream
and their roofs were the colour of the underside of an
old mushroom. Strings of onions hung from their
eaves, and milk cheeses in flat wicker baskets. After
the village came the river and the old stone bridge
that led across to the forest, tall and dark, marching
up the mountain and haunted by legends of ghosts and
knights and fairies. Mélanie, when she was in a good
humour, would tell of these, seated in the evening on
her own particular little terrace where she kept the
fowls and picked over the herbs that were to be dried
for <span class='it'>tisane</span>. But old Mère Gavrault was the best story-teller,
and Alix was sometimes allowed to go to the
forest with her and find <span class='it'>cêpes</span> and help her to gather
faggots for her winter store. Mère Gavrault told
stories of goblins and headless riders. They would
have been blood-curdling stories, had she not told
them with such an unmoved, smiling face. It was
difficult to think that Mère Gavrault would find anything
blood-curdling. She had lost so many children
and grandchildren and her husband had been drowned
in the river. She had lived through everything, and
only wanted faggots to keep her warm in winter. Her
face in its close, clean cap of coarse linen was hard and
brown and wrinkled. Yet she was only sixty-five years
old; the age of madame Gérardin, one of Maman’s
friends in Paris, whom Alix did not like. Clean, clean,
old Mère Gavrault, and she had lived through everything
and only wanted faggots; while madame Gérardin
wanted innumerable things—cigarettes all day,
for one of them; and if one were to wash her bright
countenance, what strange colours would stain the
water, what thick, pale sediments sink! Almost passionately
Alix felt her preference for Mère Gavrault,
who smelt of dew and smoke and who was as clean as
a stone or an apple. Madame Gérardin was as much
Paris as Mère Gavrault was Montarel. Yet Maman
was Paris, too, and there was nothing in the world
Alix loved as she did her mother. She had always
loved her, and longed for her, through all those mysterious
yearly separations that took her away from
her to set her down at distant Montarel. And Grand-père
must have known that she longed for her. Was it
not here that the deepest reason for the bitterness lay?
He had never spoken to her of her mother. Never;
never. Not once through all the years that she had
gone to him. They had not been unhappy, those days
of childhood with Marie-Jeanne at Montarel; even
without Maman they had known a childish gladness.
But it was as if, from the earliest age, she had had, as
it were, to be happy round the corner. One’s heart was
there, aching, if one looked at it; and one tiptoed away
cautiously and, at a safe distance, raced off to join
Marie-Jeanne. But at night, when she could no longer
hide from her heart, all the sadness of Grand-père’s
eyes would flow into her and she would lie, for hours,
awake, thinking of him and of Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was because of Maman that his footsteps had
dragged and his eyes had fixed themselves so obstinately
on the ground; perhaps it was because of her
that the Clouets had been sold;—Maman who was
his daughter-in-law and who did not bear his name.
“<span class='it'>La belle madame Vervier; divorcée, vous savez.</span>”—The
phrase came back to her, with its knife-like cut, as she
had first heard it whispered. It conjured up a vision
of harsh, cruel repudiation, of Maman driven forth
from Montarel, running out at the courtyard door,
down the steep road, like one of the hapless princesses
in the fairy-tales;—crying, flying, stumbling on the
stones. Grand-père and her father had driven her out.
So it must have been. Because of some fault; some
disastrous fault. Yet they had been cruel. Her father’s
portrait hung in the dining-room at Montarel. He was
in uniform; young, though grey-haired; with stern lips
and cold blue eyes; like Grand-père’s; like her own. She
was a Mouveray in every tint and feature; yet how unlike
them. For though, by chance currents, such other
aspects of the story as a child may apprehend came
drifting to her, the first picture of harsh repudiation
made a background to the later knowledge, and she
saw Maman as a delicate flower or fruit crushed and
broken between stony hands. Passionately she was
Maman’s child; passionately she repelled their harshness.
Yet her heart ached for Grand-père, and his
sadness flowed into her as she sat with closed eyes
thinking of him, of Marie-Jeanne, of Mère Gavrault
and Montarel; Grand-père dead and the château sold;
the solitary, sunny old château on the hill that she
would never see again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Alix opened her eyes. Someone was standing still
before her. Of all the footsteps that came and went,
these had stopped. For a moment, so deeply was she
sunk in the vision of the past, she stared bewildered at
the young man in khaki, forgetting where she was and
how she had come there. Then a jostling, irrelevant
crowd of recent memories pressed forward:—“They
will be glad to see my darling”; the grey Channel; the
faces like earthenware jugs. And, even before she had
identified him as monsieur Giles, a suffocating relief
rose in her at the sight of him, while, strangely, one
more memory seemed, on the threshold of the new
life, to offer itself with a special significance, a special
interpretation of what she was to find;—the memory
of Maman, herself, and Captain Owen standing together
in the Place de la Concorde and of Maman’s
voice saying to him, as they looked at the spot where
the guillotine had been, at Strasbourg, still in her
crêpe, and up the Champs Élysées, while splendid
clouds sailed in the blue above them:—“We are not
like you, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>. Tocsins, tumbrils, trumpets are
in our blood;—Saint Bartholomew; the Revolution;
Napoleon. Your history knows no rivers of blood and
no arcs of triumph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was monsieur Giles, of course, and he was like
Captain Owen, only <span class='it'>en laid</span>. He was tall and young
and grave with round, solemn eyes, staring at her, and
a big mouth. And he was very good; she saw that at
once; and then she saw that he was deeply troubled.
“I’m so horribly sorry,” was what he said. But it was
more than embarrassment at the miscarriage of their
meeting and dismay at her plight, though the echo of
her own distressful state came to her from his face.
She, who from the earliest age seemed to have been
fashioned by life to read the signs of discomfort and
restraint in the faces of those about her, knew now
unerringly that this good young man, who had no
tocsins or tumbrils or trumpets in his blood, was
deeply troubled at seeing her. “I’m so horribly sorry,”
he repeated, and he seized her dressing-case, Maman’s
old discarded one with the tarnished monogram
“H. de M.,” from which the crest had fallen away.
“You’ve been here for hours,” he said. “Your
mother’s letter did not give the day. Her wire only
came this afternoon, late. We are a good way from
London and trains are bad.” He was not trying to
throw the blame on anybody. His voice accepted it
all for himself; but she knew that the mistake had
been Maman’s, Maman so forceful, so practical, yet
so careless, too. Maman had taken it for granted that
they lived quite near London; she had taken it for
granted that the wire would arrive in good time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you had anything to eat?” monsieur Giles
almost shouted at her. “Where’s your box? Is this
all? I’m so horribly sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, this is all. It has not been so long, really.
I have not eaten. I was afraid to go to the restaurant
lest I should miss you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her English was so good that she saw him at once
a little reassured. He had shouted like that partly
from embarrassment and partly because he thought
she might only understand if he talked loud. His face,
as he seized her box in his other hand, echoed her
smile as it had echoed her distress. It was a kind face.
It echoed people’s feelings easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me take the bag; you cannot carry all,” said
Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he shoved himself sideways through the door
and then held it open while she passed out, commenting
as he did so, “But, I say, you’re not a child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year makes a great difference,” said Alix. “And
I was not really so young; already fifteen, when Captain
Owen first saw me, last October, in Cannes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Giles said nothing to this, and she wondered
what Captain Owen had written of her and
Maman after that first meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they were sitting opposite each other at a
little table that seemed to have a great many cruets
and salt-cellars upon it. It was a very bright and very
ugly room, and through the doors, opening and shutting
incessantly, came the muffled roar of incoming
trains; but after the waiting-room it was homelike.
She was safe with monsieur Giles. He was a person
who made you feel safe. Soup was put before them,
all substance and no savour, but she ate it eagerly,
and said that, yes, please, she would like fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the beef,” said Giles to the waiter, who
had a pallid face and looked, Alix thought, detached
and meditative as he was, like a <span class='it'>littérateur</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t advise the beef, Sir,” he said in a low,
impassive voice. “It’s specially tough to-day, Sir.
You’d do better with the mutton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mutton, then, by all means!” said Giles, laughing.
“Rather nice, that, what?” he asked, smiling at Alix
across the table when the waiter was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He showed beautiful white teeth when he smiled.
They were his only beauty; though she liked his
golden-green eyes, fig-coloured. His face was vehement,
almost violent in structure with a prominent
nose and so high a top to his head that it seemed to be
boiling over. Though he looked so kind, he looked also
as if he could get angry rather easily, with a steady,
reasonable anger, and the more she observed him the
less she found him like his brother. Captain Owen’s
lips, though broad, had been delicately curved, and
his nut-shaped eyes had always seemed to smile a
little lazily. Sweetness rather than strength had been
in his face and an air of taking everything lightly.
She had always felt of him that he would fight just as
if he were playing tennis; whereas when Giles fought,
she felt sure, he would clench his teeth and look fierce
and sick. And though he was younger than Captain
Owen, he was far more worn, strangely worn for one
so young; and he was not at all <span class='it'>homme du monde</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Owen had always struck them as <span class='it'>homme
du monde</span>. But even Maman could not have been sure
about that, since she had so emphatically impressed
upon Alix that she was to define for her with exactitude
the social status of the Bradleys. Maman was
sure that they were not <span class='it'>noblesse</span>; but Alix was to tell
her whether they were <span class='it'>petite noblesse</span> or <span class='it'>haute bourgeoisie</span>,
or, <span class='it'>tout simplement, commerçants</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that, I think,” said Maman thoughtfully;
“but with another race it is difficult to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And since Captain Owen was so much our friend,
what interest can it have for us?” Alix had inquired,
with the dryness she could sometimes show towards
Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maman had replied that it made no difference at all
as far as an individual, at large, as it were, unattached
and irresponsible in a foreign country, was concerned;
but that it did make a difference, all the difference,
when it came to the family itself and its <span class='it'>milieu</span>. “At
all events, they are rich, I am sure of that,” said
Maman; but Alix, as she ate her fish and looked across
at monsieur Giles, was not so sure. He was rather
shabby; even for an old uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he said, “I’m not going to take you
to Sussex to-night. It’s too late and you’re too tired.
Don’t try to eat that nasty sauce; scrape it off and
leave it. I apologize for our sauces, Mademoiselle.—I’m
going to take you to my aunt’s. She’ll be able to
put us up and I’ll telephone to her now. Don’t run
away in disgust with us and our sauces, while I’m
gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no danger of that. Even when he was
not there, Alix felt herself safe in the hands of monsieur
Giles, and the waiter when he brought the mutton
helped her very considerately, as though he recognized
her as young and tired and a foreigner, and
placed before her, almost with a paternal air, a dish
half of which was devoted to <span class='it'>pommes de terre à l’eau</span>
and half to a slab of dark green cabbage strangely
struck into squares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve wired to Mummy, too,” said Giles, when he
came back, “and told her we’ll turn up to-morrow
morning; so that’s all right.” And now he asked her
questions. What did she read? Did she care for
pictures and music? How had she learned to speak
such admirable English?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix told him that she and Maman had often
spoken English together and that she had had English
governesses. “I always liked your books, too. That
made it easier. ‘Alice’ and the rabbit and ‘Pride and
Prejudice’ and ‘Dombey and Son.’ Have you read
those?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he had. “There are no books in France for
girls to read as far as I can make out,” he added; and
Alix, suspecting a hint of detraction, replied: “Our
<span class='it'>chefs d’œuvre</span> are for later in life. Perhaps great books
cannot be written for girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I question that!” said Giles, smiling at her.
“Great books should be written for everybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can read Racine and Corneille and Lamartine,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Bossuet,” said Giles, grinning, “and ‘Les
Pensées de Pascal.’ Awfully jolly, isn’t it! Unfortunate
child;—or, rather, fortunate, since you <span class='it'>can</span> read us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix reflected, a little vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s another kind of sauce,” said Giles, as a
portion of apricot tart was placed before each of them
surrounded by a yellow glutinous substance. “I’ll
grant you your cooking if you’ll grant me the best
books for everybody.—Anyhow, I see you’re too tired
to argue. We’ll fight it out some other time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you come to appreciate our cooking
so well?” Alix asked. “It is made with flour, this
sauce, not properly cooked;—that is the trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is that it’s the same sauce as the one
that went with the fish, only coloured to look different.—I
travelled in France when I was a boy, you see.
And I’m just back from nine months there. I was
in the East before that, for the first years of the
war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In France for nine months? Why did you not
come to see us?” Alix asked. She asked it without
stopping to think, for it was so strange that they
should not have seen Captain Owen’s brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was at the front, and wanted all my leaves at
home,” said Giles, and he smiled very brightly at her.
He did not look at all embarrassed now; yet she had
a surmise. He stopped himself from showing embarrassment.
Surely he could have come? Had he not
wanted to come? And he was going on talking, while
he paid the bill, as if he felt she might be asking herself
that question: “My aunt lives in a part of London
called Chelsea. At the time ‘Pride and Prejudice’ was
written, it was all gardens there; it’s mostly flats now.
We’ve changed very much, in all sorts of ways from
the England of ‘Pride and Prejudice’; just as you have
from the France of Lamartine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was dimmed with fog as they drove
through the streets and she was suddenly very sleepy,
yet she kept on thinking, as she looked out, of those
nine months that monsieur Giles had been in France.
He must have been there, then, when Captain Owen
was killed. How strange that he had never come, and
that Captain Owen had never spoken of him. She was
too sleepy, however, to think of it very carefully and,
when they stopped at the brightly lighted door of a
large building, she stumbled in alighting so that Giles,
with a steadying “Hello, hello,” put a hand under her
elbow and guided her into a lift; and, still so sustained,
she was presented a moment later to a stout, rosy
lady with <span class='it'>pince-nez</span> and smooth grey hair who herself
opened the door of a white and green <span class='it'>appartement</span>
and said: “Poor child, she must be put to bed at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Giles she passed to Aunt Bella, who smelt of
toilet vinegar and had a seal ring on her small glazed-looking
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that Alix was only drowsily aware of a little
pink bedroom where a row of pink, blue and green
water-colours framed in gilt hung upon the walls.
Her head sank into a pillow and all the troubled
thoughts into sleep; but, just before she was quite
oblivious, a little tap came to the door; it opened
softly and a tall head, silhouetted on the lighted hall,
looked in, and Giles said, “Good-night, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was treating her as a child and it made her feel
very safe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For many hours the little French girl slept on dreamlessly,
and when she woke it was as if an abyss of space
and time lay between her and yesterday morning. As
she gazed up at the dim ceiling, only the most recent
memories wove themselves softly into her returning
sense of identity: the yellow sauce that Giles had told
her to scrape off; his faded khaki necktie; Aunt Bella’s
small, glazed hands. Kindness, security, lay behind
these appearances, and an apprehension of pain
seemed at first substanceless and irrational. Then,
with a gathering effort, it shaped itself: France;
Maman; what was she doing and was she happy?—She
had not been really happy yesterday morning.
Why had monsieur Giles been so troubled when they
met? And why had he never come to see them in all
the nine months he had been in France?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tap at the door and an elderly maid
came in, neatly capped, bearing a brass hot-water-can,
which she stood in the basin. Then she drew the curtains
and turned up the electric light and placed by
the bedside a very amusing little tea-set on a tray.
It was Alix’s initiation into early-morning tea, and
for a moment, as she gazed at it, she feared it was to
be all her breakfast until the maid, withdrawing, said,
very distinctly, as though she might be deaf: “Breakfast
at nine, Miss; and the bathroom is opposite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all right, then. Alix lifted the lid of the
little pot and sniffed at the tea and decided that the
afternoon was the only time at which she felt drawn
to it. And as for the two slices of bread and butter,
they were very thin, but she would rather save her
appetite. Meanwhile there was a real <span class='it'>brouillard de
Londres</span> pressing close against the window, so close
that one could see nothing—Alix had jumped up to
look—except the spectral top of a tree below the
window and, below the tree, a blurred street-lamp.
It was interesting, exciting, to get up like this as if it
were after dinner instead of before breakfast, for there
were lights in the hall and bathroom and one’s morning
face had such a curious look as one combed one’s
hair under an electric bulb. She forgot her waking
apprehensions as she dressed, and when she went into
the dining-room and found Giles there, the day seemed
to have started really well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was reading a newspaper, standing under the
light. The room was small and he looked very large
in it; so did a pink, frilled ham on the sideboard and
an engraving hanging over the mantelpiece of an old,
erect gentleman, <span class='it'>en favoris</span>, his hands on a book and
with a very high collar. When Aunt Bella came in a
moment later, they all seemed quite crowded between
the fog outside and the steam from the shining kettle
on the table, and it was rather, Alix thought, as though
they were floating in a little boat on a misty sea or
suspended—this was a more exciting comparison—high
in the air in an aeroplane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was seated opposite the mantelpiece, Giles
under it, and, following her eyes, Aunt Bella said:
“That is our great Mr. Gladstone, Alix. You’ve
heard of Mr. Gladstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had to confess that she had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll have heard of George Washington,
then,” said Aunt Bella. “There he is, behind you.”
And Alix turned round to look up at the austere face
in powdered hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was an American, was he not, and your
enemy?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was the enemy of one of our foolish kings,”
said Aunt Bella, “but an Englishman, and one we are
all proud of. And that’s Cobden.” She completed her
educational round with the third large engraving that
hung near the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, perhaps,” said Giles, “you’ll like to
hear what they all did and why Aunt Bella has them
hanging here. By the time you do that you’ll have
quite a good idea of modern English history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix for a moment was afraid that Aunt Bella might
really be going to instruct her, and she had not the
least wish to know anything about any of the respectable
gentlemen who presided over the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Giles was going on, with his bantering smile.
“If you go to Aunt Bella, you’ll get a one-sided impression,
perhaps. She’s a great Liberal. We are all
Liberals in my family. What you’d call Republicans.—Aunt
Bella, you’re not asking this helpless French
child to drink tea for her breakfast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t she have tea?” Aunt Bella asked, and
though Alix insisted that she did not mind it at all,
there was much concerned conversation, and the
elderly maid was summoned and told to ask cook to
make some cocoa for the young lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hate tea, I suppose,” said Giles, and Alix
replied that she liked it very much at five o’clock, and
Giles went on: “Whereas Aunt Bella likes it at all
hours of the day and night; and Indian tea, I’m
grieved to say; it’s the only rift within our lute, Aunt
Bella’s Indian tea;—since we do agree about Gladstone.
Now you’re a Royalist, I suppose, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely no rational person in France is a Royalist
any longer,” said Aunt Bella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grand-père did not love the Republic,” said Alix,
“but Maman admires Napoleon and the Revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sometimes think we shall get both a revolution
and a Napoleon in this country,” said Aunt Bella,
“at the rate things seem to be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll never be a revolution in England,” said
Giles. “People who drink Indian tea could never
make a revolution, could they, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think so,” Alix smiled. “Nor in a country
with such fogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good idea! Eh, Aunt Bella? People
must see each other clearly in order to hate each
other sufficiently.—What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just it,” Alix nodded, laughing. “And you
are all so kind. Kinder, I am sure, than we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Giles understood each other. He treated
her like a child, yet they understood each other,
really, better than he and Aunt Bella, for she looked
a little cautious when Giles embarked on his sallies,
as if she did not quite know in what admission he
might not involve her unless she were careful. She
took things <span class='it'>au pied de la lettre</span>, Aunt Bella, as, after
all, an elderly lady would do who sat down to breakfast
every morning with such cold comfort on her
walls as Messieurs Gladstone, Cobden, and Washington.
A row of smiling Watteau engravings hung
round Maman’s little dining-room in the rue de Penthièvre.
Alix did not think that Gladstone, Cobden,
or Washington would look with an eye of approval
at <span class='it'>Le Départ pour Cythère</span> or the <span class='it'>Assemblée Galante</span>.
Though Washington might. She liked him far the
best of the three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does your grandfather really expect to get
the Bourbons back?” Aunt Bella inquired. “You
are a Roman, I suppose, my dear child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Roman?” Alix, for all her English, was perplexed.
“I have no Italian blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She means your church,” said Giles. “And
Catholics, in France, do really all want back a king,
don’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a Catholic,” said Alix, “and so, of course,
was Grand-père, and he certainly did not like the
Republic. We had a very unscrupulous, intriguing
mayor at Montarel and perhaps that was one reason.
But I do not think that Grand-père expected anything
any more or thought at all about kings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very strange people, the French,” Aunt Bella
remarked, as if the fact were so patent that one of
them, being present, could not object to its statement.
“A very strange people, indeed. And where do you
say your grandfather lives, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is dead,” said Alix. “It was at Montarel he
lived; near the Alps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have noticed the water-colours of
Avignon that I did some years ago, hanging in your
bedroom,” said Aunt Bella. “Parts of France are very
picturesque. But I prefer our scenery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Giles, looking at his watch, “we
must be thinking about our train. Are you packed up,
Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your mother,” said Aunt Bella, “that I
expect her on Thursday for the two committees.
She’ll spend the night, of course.” And when Alix’s
box and bag had been brought and a taxi summoned,
Aunt Bella said to her very kindly, as they stood for
farewells in the hall: “You must come again and see
me, my dear, when you are in London. I could take
you to the National Gallery and Westminster Abbey,
and, if you care about Social Work, you might be
interested in my Infant Welfare Centre and Working
Girls’ Gymnasium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she an official, your aunt?” Alix inquired as
she and Giles drove off to the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An unofficial official,” Giles explained. “She runs
more things than most officials. She sits on councils
and governs hospitals and makes speeches. There
can’t be a busier woman in London and she’s a splendid
old girl;—though I do enjoy pulling her leg.”
And then, since Alix was startled by this expression,
also new to her, he had again to explain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The third-class carriage was not foul and wooden as
it would have been in France, and they had it to themselves;
but the cushions smelt of fog, and Alix thought
she had never seen anything so ugly as the view from
the window. It had been too dark to see the suburbs
of London the night before, on the way up from Newhaven;
but they lay all mean and low and toad-coloured
this morning, wet under the lifted fog, and for
as far as the eye could follow there was nothing to
be seen but squatting roofs and gaunt factory chimneys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, isn’t it?” said Giles. He sat opposite her,
looking out with his face so young and so worn. She
liked him so much and felt so safe with him, and yet
it frightened her a little to look at him, just—strange
association—as it had frightened her to look at Grand-père.
Only Giles was kinder, far, than Grand-père.
“But worse, do you think,” he went on, “than the
suburbs of Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix did not quite like to say how much worse she
thought it; it did not seem polite. “There, at least,
one has the sky to look at,” she suggested. “It is
happier, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not always in a fog, you know,” said Giles.
“And Aunt Bella is very keen on Smoke Abatement.
Perhaps we’ll look happier some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very glad your family does not live in London,”
said Alix. She felt more shy of Giles this morning,
shut up with him in the intimacy of the chill,
smoky carriage, than she had last night in the station
dining-room. And it was as if she felt him more shy,
too. They were making talk a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you have come, if we’d lived in London?”
he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maman would have sent me just the same, I
think,” said Alix. “She wanted me to know England.
And your family, specially, of course. Captain Owen
always said I must know his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Of course,” said Giles. He got up then
and looked at the heat regulator and said it was cold,
did she mind? There seemed no heat. Then he sat
down again and fell into a silence, his arms folded, his
long legs stretched as best they could, before him, and
they both, again, looked out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On it went, the dreadful city; but at last furtive
squares and triangles of green were stealing into it and
sparsely placed trees edged streets that adventured
forth, at random, it seemed, to end, almost with a stare
of forlorn astonishment, in fields ravaged of every
trace of beauty. But the green spread and widened
like a kindly tide, and though the brick and slate was
encrusted at intervals, like an eruption, upon the
land, there were copses and rises of meditative meadow
and the white sky was melting here and there to a
timid blue above little hamlets that seemed to have
a heart and to be breathing with a life of their own.
Beside a brook a girl was strolling with scarf and
stick, two joyous dogs racing ahead of her; a cock-pheasant
ran, startled, through a wood sprinkled
with gold and russet, and presently there was a
deeper echo of the blue overhead in the blue of quiet
hills on the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is better, isn’t it?” said Giles, bringing his
eyes to her at last. “Don’t you call this pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty,” said Alix. And it was pretty, though
to her eyes it was also insignificant and confused, its
lack of design or purpose teasing her mind with its
contradiction of the instinct for order and shapeliness
that dwelt there. “Is it because of the season and
your mistiness that everything seems very near one?
The horizon is so near, and even the sky comes quite
close down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like nice, kind arms, I always think,” said Giles.
“No, even in the Lake Country, even in Scotland, we
don’t get your splendid distances; or very rarely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is very pretty,” Alix repeated. “I like the
woods. Did you see the girl and the dogs a little while
ago? I imagine that your sisters look like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our dogs look like that. Ruth and Rosemary
aren’t quite so grown up. We have three dogs. Are
you fond of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very fond; though I have never had a dog of
my own. Maman thinks them too much trouble for
a little <span class='it'>appartement</span> in Paris. But I had a cat at
Montarel. A yellow cat with blue eyes. Have you
ever seen one like that? He was so affectionate and
intelligent and remembered me perfectly from year
to year. He used to put his paws on my breast and
rub against my face. The thought of seeing him again
made it easier to bear leaving Maman when my half-year
at Montarel came round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your half-year at Montarel?” Giles asked the
question, but she saw that it was after a hesitation.
She wondered how much Captain Owen had told
them. She felt suddenly that she wanted to tell Giles
everything there was to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spent half the year with Grand-père at Montarel
and half with Maman in Paris. Did you not know?”
she said, looking him in the eyes. “My father and
mother were parted. They were divorced. But it
could not have been more Maman’s error since the
judge allowed her to have me for half the time. It is
arranged like that, you know, as fairer. And since my
father died when I was hardly more than a baby, it
was Grand-père who had me for that side of the family.—I
tell it to you as I imagine it to have been, for
Maman has never spoken to me of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was making it easy. He was looking at her
with no sign of discomfort, looking, indeed, as if he
knew it already. “Oh, yes,” he said. And then he
added: “And when your grandfather died? Was there
no one else on his side of the family? Don’t you go to
Montarel any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one at all,” said Alix, shaking her head. “I
am the last of the Mouverays. That was why the
château was sold and why Maman has me now entirely.
But though it was sad to lose my grandfather,
I love my mother best of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you won’t miss her too much,” said Giles
after a moment and in a kind voice. “We’ll try to give
you a happy life, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure you will. But one must always miss
one’s mother and one’s country. And then I always
wonder if she is happy. Though I am only a child,
she depends on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the comfort of knowing that Paris is
only a few hours away,” said Giles, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but Cannes isn’t. She is to be at Cannes this
winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I remember. She spends the winters at
Cannes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She enjoys her life there. She plays tennis beautifully
and has so many friends, as perhaps Captain
Owen told you. But I know that she misses me. I
have always been with her there before. I was with
her, you know, when Captain Owen met us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should rather say I did know,” said Giles. “We
heard all about your kindness to him, you may be sure.
You may be sure we are a very grateful family.”
Giles spoke with heartiness, and though she felt something
a little forced in it there was nothing forced in
his evident kindness towards herself. They were talking
happily. As they had talked last night at dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you may be sure we heard all about you,”
said Alix, smiling across at him. “All about Ruth and
Rosemary and Francis and Jack. What a large family
you are. It must be very happy being so many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say!” laughed Giles, “you have a good memory!
To get us in our order, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could I forget when he told us so much!
We saw all your photographs so often. Only one does
not get so clear an idea from photographs. I would not
have known you from yours. And there was Toppie.
After your mother, he talked most of all about Toppie.
I shall see her, too, shall I not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if she had struck him. The violent red that
mounted to his face was echoed in Alix’s cheeks. It
was as if, with her innocent words, she had struck him,
and in the silence that followed them, while he gazed
at her, and she, helplessly, gazed back, she saw that
what had underlain the confusion of yesterday had
simply been suffering. She had laid it bare. She was
looking at it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to master it; to conceal it; in a moment he
stammered: “Oh, he talked most about Toppie, did
he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she not his betrothed?” asked Alix in a feeble
voice. She felt exhausted. He had struck her, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she was,” said Giles, and his eyes now
lifted from her face and fixed themselves over her head
on Maman’s dressing-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And—is she not still living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie? Living?” His eyes came back to her. “I
should rather say so. You see,” he went on at once,
though Alix could not see the relevance, “she was so
horribly cut up by his death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” Alix murmured. “I am so sorry. I
should not have spoken of him at all, when you have
lost him. I did not mean to be stupid; unfeeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good Heavens! you’re not stupid! Not a bit
unfeeling!” cried Giles, and seeing her distress, his
eyes actually filled with tears. “It’s not Owen at all.
We often speak of him. It’s Toppie. And it’s I who
am such a dunderhead. You see, she’s all that’s left of
him. I mean, all that’s loveliest; most sacred. She
cared for him so much. She’s like something in a
shrine, to us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Yes. I see. I understand,” said Alix; though,
still, she could not see. “I spoke lightly. I do not forgive
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s nothing to do with you,” Giles almost
shouted as he had shouted at her last night. “I always
get like that when she’s talked about, with him.
You poor, dear child, it’s nothing on earth to do with
you. It’s absolutely my stupidity,” Giles assured her,
their suffusion giving his eyes a strange heaviness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be left at that. There was nothing for her to
say. He was suffering and he tried to conceal from her
how much; but she had seen it too plainly. All unwittingly
she had blundered, blundered horribly, in speaking
of Captain Owen and his betrothed, and a sense of
depression, dark, like the London fog, penetrating and
bitter like the London smoke, settled upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s the station! There’s Mummy!” cried Giles.
They had sat silent, and now he sprang up as if with
great gaiety. He was doing his best. He was trying to
make her forget; it was a little stupid of him if he
thought he could succeed, Alix felt; but she summoned
a responsive smile with which to greet Giles’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recognized her at once as the train slid into the
little station. She stood there, tall and slender, wistful
and intent, with her spare grey skirt and black hat and
scarf, and hair straying about her ears, as shy, as
gentle as a girl. In her photograph, seen at Cannes,
it had seemed incredible that she should be Captain
Owen’s mother, and though her face showed as faded
and worn in the morning light, it was even more incredibly
young. She must be fifty, yet Maman, unflawed
and radiant in her thirty-seven summers, had
a greater maturity of aspect. “She is so innocent,”
thought Alix; not clearly seeing, yet deeply feeling the
meaning of the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was walking beside the train, smiling up at
them, her hand laid on the window of their carriage,
and Giles did not wait for it to stop before he sprang
out beside her and kissed her, doffing his cap. There
was no confusion, no trouble, in the eyes of Giles’s
mother; they had nothing to hide; this was the next
thought that came to Alix; they were only shy and
sweet and sad. She did not speak at first. She took
Alix by the hand and stood so holding her while Giles
got out the dressing-case, and then led her along beside
them, glancing down at her as they went; and
Alix saw that with all the memories her own presence
recalled, words were too difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was telling of the Victoria disaster. “I missed
that first train, Mummy. I didn’t get to Victoria till
nearly two hours after hers had come in. But she’s forgiven
us. She’s a most forgiving disposition,” said
Giles, “I’ve discovered that. She won’t resent any of
the wrongs we put upon her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hours! How dreadful! Oh, how dreadful!”
Mrs. Bradley was exclaiming, “What must you have
thought of us, Alix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it wasn’t your wrong, at all,” said Alix; “it
was Maman’s mistake. I think telegrams take very
long now from France to England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There always <span class='it'>are</span> mistakes about meetings,” said
Mrs. Bradley. “Dreadful things always <span class='it'>do</span> seem to
happen.—Shall I drive, Giles, dear? or sit behind
with Alix so that we can talk? That will be best,
I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove over commons and along woodland
roads. The air was white and chill yet dimly transfused
with sunlight, and there was a smell of wet pine-trees
and wet withered heather. Alix’s spirits lifted a
little with the scent and swiftness, and they lifted still
further, seeming, like the sky, to show a rift of blue,
when in her gentle, slightly hoarse voice, Mrs. Bradley
said: “Is your mother well, dear? How did you leave
her?” This was the first inquiry about Maman she had
heard, the first interest she had seen displayed. Giles,
she remembered it now, had volunteered not a remark
or question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wrote so kindly,” said Mrs. Bradley. “She
understood, I know, how much we hoped to see you
here, how much pleasure it would give us. I wish she
could have come, too. Owen so often wrote about you
both, from Cannes. He said you made him think of
Jeanne d’Arc, and your mother of Madame Récamier.—I’m
glad you still do your hair like that,” said Mrs.
Bradley, smiling shyly, and Alix saw that she had forgotten
nothing and that all the links that Giles had
ignored were cherished by her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were links, however, that she would not see.
That must be, Alix reflected, what she had felt as her
innocence. The pleasure that her coming might give
to the Bradleys had never been part of Maman’s motive.
She had taken it for granted, but it had not
counted. Maman had sent her because she had conceived
of the winter in England as an advantage for
her child and because—Alix saw further into these motives
than Maman intended her to do—it had not been
convenient to take her to Cannes. But there were few
of Maman’s motives, Alix felt, as she listened to the
gentle, hesitating voice, that Mrs. Bradley would divine.
Perhaps it was that that made Maman seem so
much the older. Yet Maman, too, might have blindnesses.
She would have been blind, for instance, in
saying of Mrs. Bradley—and Alix could hear her saying
it: “<span class='it'>Un peu bê-bête, n’est-ce pas, ma chérie?</span>” Mrs.
Bradley was simple, very simple; but she was not <span class='it'>bête</span>.
Alix felt that she understood Mrs. Bradley as Maman
would not understand her, and it was perhaps because
of this that Mrs. Bradley spoke presently about her
dead son, for to any one who did not understand her
she could not have spoken. She would never be <span class='it'>bête</span>
about things like that. She was longing to speak about
him, Alix saw; to ask questions, to reënforce her store
of precious memories by such fragments as the little
French girl could offer her. Alix told her of their walks
above the sea at Cannes, of the concerts he had so
loved, and of how much he had had to tell and teach
them of flowers and birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, the birds; he loved them,” said Mrs.
Bradley, turning away her eyes that were full of tears.
She was like this November day, with its suffused sunlight,
and fresh, sad fragrance; there were no tocsins
or trumpets in her blood, either; yet all the same she
knew what suffering was as well as Maman. The
hoarseness of her voice had come, perhaps, in part
from crying; something scared, that one caught in
her glance at moments, had not been there, Alix felt
sure, before the war; before the news of her son’s
death had been brought to her. And as Alix thought
of Captain Owen’s death and of what his mother
must have felt, there rose in her memory a picture
of a Spring morning in Paris, the wild, wet day,
with shafts of sunlight slanting through the rain and
striking great spaces on the pavements to azure. She
had been standing at the window of their salon, looking
at the rain and sunlight, and at the flower-woman
on the corner opposite, her basket heaped with pink
and white tulips, and she had heard Maman, suddenly,
behind her, saying, as if she had forgotten that Alix
was there: “<span class='it'>Dieu!—Dieu!—Dieu!</span>” And, looking
round she had seen her with the letter in her lap and
had read the catastrophe in her white face and horror-filled
eyes. So many of their friends had fallen in the
war, but for none of them had Maman mourned as she
had for Captain Owen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car turned, now, with careful swiftness, into an
entrance gate which opened against a well-clipped
hedge. A curve among the trees brought them to the
front of a large house, red brick below, gables above,
with beams and plaster. A great many gables, a
great many creepers, large windows open to the air.
A kind, capacious house, promising comfort; but how
ugly, thought Alix, as they alighted; “<span class='it'>Combien peu
intéressante.</span>” It was difficult to believe that from
its cosy portals Captain Owen and Giles had gone
forth to tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two girls, at the sound of the car, had burst out
upon the steps, and three dogs; an Irish terrier, a fox
terrier, and a West Highland terrier;—“I like him
best”—thought Alix of the last;—and they bounded
in the air while the girls shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Giles, you did serve us a turn last night!
Your wire never got here until this morning! We sat
up till eleven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wore knitted jumpers and had corn-coloured
hair and pink faces. They were delighted to see their
brother back after his misadventures; the dogs were
delighted to see him; only the dogs did not shout,
which was an advantage. Alix had never heard such a
noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here is Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley, who had
stopped to take the appealing fox terrier in her arms;
the fox terrier was a lady, no longer young, and the uproar
affected her too much; Mrs. Bradley soothed and
reassured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth and Rosemary, as though aware for the first
time of Alix’s presence, turned their attention to her
and cried “Hello” heartily, while they shook her by
the hand. They were like Aunt Bella in their rosiness,
robustness, their air of doing things all the time with
absorption and energy; and like Aunt Bella and the
house they were “<span class='it'>peu intéressantes</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have a good crossing? Are you a good
sailor?” asked Rosemary; while Ruth said: “Let me
carry up her bag.—Do you play hockey?—<span class='it'>Jouissez-vous
le hockey?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She speaks English better than you do,” said Giles,
pulling his sister’s rope of hair; “and your French is a
disgrace to your family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went into a hall that had wide windows in
unexpected places and an important oak staircase
winding up from it, also in an unexpected place. Alix
was dimly aware of earnest, cheerful attempts at originality
in its design; but the originality did not go beyond
the windows and staircases, the high wainscotting
and oaken pillars. Everything else, from the
brasses of the big chimney-place to the florid crétonnes
on the window-seats, followed a bright household formula.
The brightness would have been a little oppressive
had it not lapsed to a benign shabbiness, and the
two good-tempered maids who followed with Alix’s
box belonged to it all, ornamental in their crisp
pink print dresses, yet a little dishevelled; their caps
perched far back on large protuberances of hair and
fashionable whiskers of curl coming forward on their
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix felt all sorts of things about the hall and about
the crétonnes and about the maids as Ruth and Rosemary
and the dogs hustled her along. What it
amounted to she did not clearly know, except that
Giles did not really go with the hall, while his sisters
did, and that Mrs. Bradley did not like the caps
and the whiskers, but that she would always sacrifice
her own tastes—hardly aware that she had
them—to other people’s cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, of course you play tennis,” Ruth was saying.
“Everybody plays tennis. But you must learn
hockey at once. It’s the great game at our school and
you’re nowhere unless you play it.—Down Bobby,
down! He’s made friends with you already.—The
mud will come off all right.—One can’t mind mud if
one has dogs, can one? Down, you silly duffer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. Let him jump. I am fond of dogs,”
said Alix, patting the ardent head of the Irish terrier.
“What is the name of the little, low, white one? He is
quieter, but I think he likes me too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name is Jock, and Mummy’s fox terrier is Amy.
Oh, they’ll all like you, all right; they’re as friendly as
possible—though Amy can be a bit peevish at moments;
Mummy spoils her.—Here’s your room,” said
Rosemary, ushering her in. “It’s a jolly room, isn’t it?
Mummy thought you’d like the one with the view best.
The other spare-room looks over the kitchen-garden.
It’s a jolly view, isn’t it? One doesn’t often get a view
like that. Put the box here, Edie.—Oh, the bathroom
is on the landing, that door, you see. We have our
baths in the morning and the water doesn’t run very
hot for more than two. So will you have yours at
night? Mummy does. Ruth and I like it best in the
morning, and Giles doesn’t mind if his is cold.—French
people don’t care about baths, anyway, do
they?—Lunch will be ready in twenty minutes. Can
you find your way down?” Rosemary added rapidly,
her eye on the staircase where Giles was descending,
“I want to speak to Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t! It’s my place to tell him first!”
screamed Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about the football, Giles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up!” shouted Giles affectionately. “What
a frightful row you’re making!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Alix at last heard them all hurtling down the
stairs together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jock, who was old and a little melancholy, remained
with her, seating himself on the hearth rug and surveying
her with kindly but disenchanted eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dieu! Quel bruit!</span>” Alix addressed him. She felt
that Jock agreed with her about the noise and in
finding Ruth and Rosemary, as well as Bobby, too
turbulent. She listened at the door to be sure that they
were safely gone. Then she tiptoed softly down and
peeped in at the bathroom. It was large and untidy.
She, too, preferred her bath hot and in the morning.
Ruth and Rosemary were kind, but your preferences
would never stand in the way of theirs. No, never
would she find them interesting. But they did not ask
it of you, Alix reflected, going back to her room. All
they asked of you was to let them bathe at the time
that best pleased them, play hockey with them, and
admire their view. She went to look at the view. A
pleasant, heathery common dipping at its further edge
to a birch-wood. That was all. And another gabled
roof rose among pines on a near hillside. All comfort;
no beauty, thought Alix, and the sky came so closely
down that it made her feel suffocated. And as she
leaned looking out she thought of the roll of the
mighty Juras, and the plain, and the river shining
across it. How tame this was, a piping, perching little
bird beside an eagle of great flights and soarings. Why
had Maman sent her here? She could never be happy;
never, never, under this low sky, among these noisy
girls. And wave after wave there mounted in her an
old, well-remembered homesickness for Maman and a
new homesickness for France.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>She was not to escape Ruth and Rosemary for long.
Already, at lunch, she felt that Giles, talking gravely
with his mother of treaties and leagues and such dull
matters, seemed to have relegated her to their category.
Over the dining-room mantelpiece hung a portrait
of the late Mr. Bradley; she knew it must be he
from his likeness to Aunt Bella and Ruth and Rosemary,
and Alix felt sure, as she looked up at his pink
and yellow, his tweeds and watch-chain and good,
shrewd eyes, that Mrs. Bradley’s sons must always
have interested her more than their father. But she
would never have known this, just as she did not know,
nor did they, that she was fonder of her boys than of
Ruth and Rosemary. “But I believe that in this country
everybody is fonder of sons,” thought Alix, marvelling
at the reappearance of the strange cabbage cut
into squares and recalling impressions of English literature
where, despite romantic surfaces, it was apparent
to the discerning eye that men always counted
for more than women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley carved. It was a well-roasted leg
of mutton, that made Alix think of the mutton in
“Alice.” The potatoes, too, were roasted and the
<span class='it'>entremets</span> a bread-and-butter pudding. Mr. Bradley
had been nourished on such meals. They would produce
Mr. Bradleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we will show you everything,” said Ruth
when luncheon was over. The implication seemed to
be that a specially fortunate experience was in store
for her. A fond complacency breathed from both girls.
“And it is natural that one should love one’s home,”
thought Alix, the tolerance of her comprehension giving
her childish face a maturity beyond its years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she was led from the lawn to the shrubberies;
shown the summer-house where in summer they had
tea and the herbaceous border, neatly disposed for its
winter sleep. The kitchen-garden was displayed, and
at its far end they passed through a door to a little
path, bordered by gorse-bushes, that ran beneath the
garden-wall and then turned aside over the common.
It was a sheltered, solitary little path, the branches of
the garden fruit-trees hanging over it, and Alix felt
that it might often be a refuge for her. It was a
pretty path and had a character of its own. To Ruth
and Rosemary its meaning lay in leading somewhere
else, and they crossed the common and rambled in
the birch-wood, inciting each other to long jumps over
a sluggish little stream, half ditch, half brook, that
flowed through it, and encouraging the dogs with
loud cries to chase the scurrying rabbits on the further
hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the jolliest walk along the top,” said Ruth,
“among the junipers. But perhaps you are tired.
French girls aren’t much good at walking, are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I walk a good deal in the country,” said Alix,
“but I think I will unpack my box now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edie will have unpacked it for you,” said Ruth,
“so we’ll go on; only say if you are tired. You wear
sensible shoes, I must say. I thought all French girls
pinched their toes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they continued to walk, talking as they went,
asking her for none of her information, only imparting
theirs, as if it must, self-evidently, have superior value.
Alix heard them with interest when they told of Giles
and of his scholastic feats at Oxford, feats interrupted
by his departure for the war, but now to be resumed.
Philosophy was Giles’s special branch, and they told
her that he was going to teach philosophy, at Oxford
probably, and write it some day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span>” said Alix, relapsing, as was her wont when
surprised, into French. She knew nothing of philosophers
and the word only conjured up a picture of someone
aged and bearded who drank hemlock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Ruth, accepting the ejaculation as a
tribute, “he’ll be a great man, all right, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Alix also learned that Ruth and Rosemary both
intended following professional careers and that their
father had come from the north and had built Heathside
and that their mother was a Londoner and that
her father had been the editor of an important London
paper. “What! Never heard of ‘The Liberal’!”
Ruth exclaimed. Ruth, as eldest, did most of the
talking, subjected to frequent interruptions from Rosemary.
“I should have thought even French people
would have heard of ‘The Liberal.’ Oh, yes, he was a
great swell, our grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix did not think she would have found him so.
France, she saw, mainly existed for Ruth and Rosemary
as a place where one’s brothers had gone to
fight and one’s friends to nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is the pleasant house?” she inquired of
them, when, after their walk along the hilltop, they had
crossed the wood and emerged again upon the common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It stood, with an air of serenity and detachment,
half a mile away, a tall house of pale, eighteenth-century
brick with a white door and white window-sills,
a formal garden before it and a neat hedge dividing it
from the road. One felt that the woods had grown up
around it and that it preserved a tranquil personality
of its own, unmoved by the haphazard accretions of a
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s the Rectory; where Toppie lives,” said
Ruth. “You can see the church spire just above the
trees to the right. Pleasant, do you call it? I think it’s
rather dismal; so bare and square. It needs lots of
creepers and shrubberies to make it cheerful; but old
Mr. Westmacott doesn’t like them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Creepers would not be in the character of that
house, I feel,” said Alix; “and they would hide the
pretty colour of the brick. There are a few roses, too,
are there not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a few. Toppie would have her roses. I hate
a house without creepers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I soon see Toppie, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ll see her soon, all right,” said Ruth.
“She’ll be coming in to tea to-day, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she’s coming,” said Rosemary. “She
asked me yesterday if Alix would be here, and when I
told her we’d had the wire, she said she’d come. I
think she’s rather keen on seeing you, Alix. Owen
wrote a lot about you, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spoke without any emotion of Toppie. They
took her for granted. She was not, to them, a shrine.
But even before the scene in the train with Giles, Alix
had had a special feeling about Toppie herself, and as
she walked on with the chattering girls her mind went
back to the day at Cannes when Captain Owen had
first showed her and Maman Toppie’s photograph.
He carried the little leather case in his breast-pocket,
his mother’s picture on one side and hers on the other,
and Maman had said, as she took the case from him
and looked: “<span class='it'>Elle est tout-à-fait ravissante.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t see very much of her in that,” said Captain
Owen, wagging his foot a little, and Alix guessed
that he was moved in speaking of his <span class='it'>fiancée</span>. “But it
does show something. Lovely the shape of her face,
isn’t it? She’s not exactly beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! ‘exactly’! Who would care to be ‘exactly’
beautiful!” said Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had told them that Miss Westmacott—Toppie’s
real name was Enid Westmacott—had come with her
father to live near them when she was only fifteen.
Mr. Westmacott was the Rector of their parish and
he had to explain to them—for Maman said that with
all her English she could never get it quite clear—what
rectors were and how they came to have daughters;
and when Maman said, as though rectors must
make up for having daughters by having devout ones,
“<span class='it'>Elle est très dévote?</span>” Captain Owen, with his charming
smile, rejoined, “Oh, much better than that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, when they were alone, Maman had remarked
to her: “She is pretty; but nothing more.
<span class='it'>Elle est nulle, cette Toppie; très, très nulle.</span>” But Alix
had not agreed. Often she did not agree with Maman.
The little photograph had not said much, but it had
said something definite. “She is like someone in a
tower.” So she tried to fix her feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even in a tower one may oneself be insignificant,”
said Maman, and to this Alix had replied: “Not if
one <span class='it'>is</span> the tower oneself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was there when they got in. A fire had
been lighted for tea in the drawing-room, a long
room with roses on the chairs and sofas and a high
wainscotting of dark woodwork, and above that blue
paper with old-fashioned crayon portraits and large
photographs from famous pictures. A tall grey figure
stood at the further end, and Alix knew at once that
it was Toppie who turned her head to look at her like
that. She was helping Mrs. Bradley arrange flowers,
Michaelmas daisies, oak leaves, and sprays of golden
larch. She held a large bronze vase and wore a grey
tweed skirt and a grey woollen jumper and grey shoes
strapping across the instep with a buckle. Her hair
was as fair as primroses and was ruffled up a little
above the black ribbon that bound it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Alix, Toppie, dear,” said Mrs. Bradley in
a gentle voice, and she came forward and passed her
arm in Toppie’s as if she knew that it must mean
something very special to her to see the little French
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad,” said Toppie. She gazed at Alix for a
long moment, as though forgetting that she held the
vase; then, looking round her, vague in her absorption,
she set it down on a table and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water from the vase had spilled over it, and as
it closed on Alix’s it made her think of the hand of
a dryad, a naiad, or some chill, unearthly creature.
“Yes; in towers,” she thought, as Toppie’s eyes dwelt
on her. “And how much she loved him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw then that Giles was there. He was stretched
out in a deep chair on one side of the fire, his hands
clasped behind his head, and he was watching Toppie;
her meeting with Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how much Giles loves her!” came the further
thought, sharp with its sense of sudden elucidation.
If he sat there, in that rather mannerless fashion, not
helping with the water-cans, the baskets of flowers,
the scissors, it was because he loved her and wanted to
watch her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie, still with her absorption, had picked up the
vase again and carried it to a far table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There; that’s the best we can do with the garden
just now,” said Mrs. Bradley, smiling at her. “And
without you, Toppie, I’d never have made the effort.
Toppie thinks a room without flowers so sad. She
made me come out with her and pick all these. It’s
astonishing, really, what one can still find in a November
garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They look awfully nice,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to tell you the truth,” said Ruth—Alix had
already noted of her that, on all occasions, she gave her
opinion without being asked—“they look to me rather
dingy and frost-bitten. Rather a waste of time, I
think, all this messing about to arrange flowers that
don’t exist!”—and Ruth laughed, pleased with her
own good sense, and went to seat herself on the arm of
Giles’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She bores him; but he would not like to say it,”
thought Alix, seeing Giles’s kind but unwelcoming
look. She had a feeling of excitement, yet of oppression.
Toppie, she knew, was thinking of nothing but
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tea-table stood before the sofa on the other side
of the fire from Giles, and Mrs. Bradley sat down to
it and Toppie came beside her, and then, looking up
at Alix, laying her hand on the place still vacant, said
“Come here, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s room for me, too,” cried Rosemary, plunging
down between them. “My place is always near
the cake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Toppie looked at her quite coldly and said:
“There’s not room for you, Rosemary. Somewhere
else, please. You make us all uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very fair, with a skin that would have been
of a milky whiteness had it not been thickly freckled.
Her lips were small and pale, her chin long and narrow;
all her head, bound round with the black ribbon, was
singularly narrow, and that, perhaps, was why her
grey eyes seemed to look out from towers. “And how
she has suffered!” thought Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nights; how many nights of sleepless suffering had
not Toppie known. The tears had run down as she
had lain in the long darknesses, remembering; always
remembering, seeing his face before her always. Tears;
vigils; remembrance;—all were in Toppie’s eyes.
“Oh, no, Maman; not <span class='it'>nulle</span>; anything but <span class='it'>nulle</span>,”
Alix thought, while, with a great wave of depression,
the meaning of the war, of all its lonely suffering,
swept over her. Was Captain Owen worth so much
suffering? His personality lived most for Alix in the
memory of his smile and his worth seemed to live
in that, too. He had been charming; and there was
worth in charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tea was made and they were all talking of the things
they did and the people they did them with. Alix
heard of a Women’s Institute, of Boy Scouts and Girl
Guides, and a village Choral Society that Mrs. Bradley
conducted. Giles sang in it, and the girls and Jack
and Francis when they were at home. “And you must
sing with us, Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley, and they asked
her about her piano lessons and the singing at the
Lycée, and she had to confess that she had never heard
“The Messiah,” at which there was a shout of good-natured
protest from Ruth and Rosemary. “But
you’re not a musical nation, are you?” said Ruth; and
disposed of France as a musical nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk made Alix think of the thick slices of bread-and-butter
that Ruth and Rosemary and Giles were
eating, it was so kindly and useful. Very different
from the talk to which she was accustomed in Maman’s
salon; and Maman’s salon itself was as different from
this as the talk. It was small, yet it was stately. She
and Maman had done their best for the “<span class='it'>petit trou</span>”
of an <span class='it'>appartement</span> in the rue de Penthièvre, and
Maman’s russet head, as she sat with her cigarette at
the tea-table, had melted and shone against the old
tapestry, grey and green and citron, and her lovely
face had seemed to belong to the Empire sconces and
the carnations in their tall crystal vases that made
light constellations on the mantelpiece. Maman’s
salon, though stately, was dense and rich and sweet,
and the talk that passed, soft and shining, was like
a beautiful, iridescent soap-bubble tossed so lightly
from one to the other; from monsieur de Villanelle,
with his pointed red beard and sad blue eyes and long
Flemish nose like a Memling saint; to mademoiselle
Blanche Fontaine; and from her to monsieur de Maubert,
with his Jovian head; and from him to monsieur
Jules, dark and gloomy, who sometimes let it drop in
his abstraction, unless Maman gave it a little puff that
carried it on to madame Gérardin, who received it
with shrill little outcries, prettily playing with it—Alix
had to own that she played prettily with talk—until
it was safely back in Maman’s hands again. And
then another was blown. How Maman smiled; how
she lifted gay yet sombre brows; how lovely they all
thought her. And though one might see talk so light
only as a soap-bubble, Alix dimly apprehended that
it was fertile, creative; that it spread, like a sweet
fragrance; that it floated like a winged seed on the
breeze, out from Maman’s salon to permeate, alter the
world. It made a difference to the world what monsieur
Villanelle thought about the last book and poem;
what monsieur Jules thought about the last painter,
mademoiselle Blanche about the last play, and monsieur
de Maubert about the latest feat of Léon Daudet
or Charles Maurras. And since, to all of them, it was
in Maman’s reception of their ideas that the final
verdict lay, Maman, to the world at large, made the
greatest difference of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see what a jolly life you’ll have here, my
dear kid,” Rosemary remarked to her; Rosemary, undismayed
by her rebuff, had worked through the
bread-and-butter and was now eating quantities of
cake. She was only six months older than Alix, but she
assumed protecting airs towards her. “Girls in France
have a beastly mewed-up time, haven’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been much in France?” Alix asked her.
She felt no call to combat Rosemary’s conceptions.
She was, indeed, completely indifferent to what they
might be. She asked her question from mere politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much; but Ruth and I stayed with a French
family once. My word! they were quaint! They
thought the Bible improper reading for <span class='it'>jeunes filles</span>
and picked their teeth at the table and I don’t believe
they ever took a bath. They almost had apoplexy
when we said we had to have one every day; thought
it would be sure to give us <span class='it'>des rhumatismes</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many of us are quite clean,” Alix remarked, and at
this Giles laughed loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one for you, you young savage,” he commented,
whereupon Rosemary bounded at him and
grappled with his hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help, Ruth! He’s choking me!” she screamed,
and Alix, with some astonishment, watched the uncouth
game that followed, Giles throwing off his sisters
alternately until they tumbled on the floor and
sat, dishevelled and delighted, getting their breath
and smoothing back their loosened hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite so much noise, dears,” Mrs. Bradley remarked
once or twice, but she continued calmly to
converse with Toppie who glanced at the <span class='it'>mêlée</span>, Alix
thought, with a remote, repudiating eye, while she
said: “I find him a thoroughly bad boy. There’s
something fundamentally wrong with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor little fellow!” Mrs. Bradley sighed. “His
home and heredity are great handicaps, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why they should be,” said Toppie.
“Mrs. Brown is a patient hard-working woman and,
though the father drinks, I don’t think he is dishonest.
Whereas Percy is a sneak and a liar. He does mean
things and then is too much of a coward to confess
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange, thought Alix, listening, though not
in the least interested in Percy Brown’s heredity, that
with a face so sweet Toppie should have so cold a
voice. She would be sorry for Percy Brown, she felt
sure, if she were to see him confronting Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very difficult to confess when one has done a
mean thing,” Mrs. Bradley mused—and Alix almost
had to laugh at hearing her, so impossible was it to
imagine Mrs. Bradley involved in such a dilemma.
“The cowardice and the meanness go together, don’t
they, and Percy is so young that they are not worse,
really, than weakness and timidity. He may outgrow
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he will. I think he is fundamentally
bad,” said Toppie, but now with more sadness than
severity, and, turning to Alix she said: “Will you
come and have tea with me to-morrow? We could
have a little walk first, and then you could come back
to tea with me and my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s going to school with us, Toppie! We
have to teach her hockey!” cried Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-morrow. She need not begin till Monday,
need you, Alix?” Alix thought not, and though Ruth
declared, “You can’t begin a day too soon for hockey,”
Alix and Toppie had decided the question between
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me everything; everything you remember,”
said Toppie. She was striding along over the heather,
a grey woollen scarf tossed over her shoulder, a knitted
cap drawn down closely over her ears, and she made
Alix feel shy. She had seen that Toppie liked her and
she had foreseen that she would question her. But as
she felt the pressure of her longing she knew how little
she could satisfy it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I remember him best of all as I first saw
him,” she said, searching her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. As you first saw him. Tell me about it. How
did you first see him? He wrote to me, often, from
Cannes; so much about your mother; so much about
you. He said you were the dearest little girl. I understand
why he said it—if you don’t mind my saying
so.—But he couldn’t tell me what I most wanted to
know, could he? How he himself looked to you.—What
he said to you.—How he seemed.—You understand,
I know, though you are so young, how one
longs for everything that remains on earth of anyone
one loves. People’s memories; they are precious. You
understand that,” said Toppie. And Alix felt that
only by the pressure of her longing was she thus lifted
above her natural reticence. The very words she used
were not habitual to her; she would have been shy of
using such words ordinarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I understand,” said Alix. “We saw him first
on the great road that runs above the sea. Maman
and I were going up and he was coming down, so that
we saw him tall against the sky; limping a little as he
came. He looked at us, and we looked at him;—it is
almost as if one recognized the people who are destined
to be our friends, is it not, Mademoiselle?—and when
we had passed, I looked back at him and he was looking
round at us. It had been a mutual impression. We
talked of it afterwards. We saw him against the sky
and he saw us against the sea; as if we had risen from
it, like people in a fairy-tale, he told us; and Maman
laughed and said that people didn’t rise from the sea
carrying parasols. I remember so well the expression
of his eyes”—Alix felt still shyer, but she forced herself
through the shyness—“gay and searching like a
dog’s; out-of-door eyes. He had field-glasses in his
hand. And that very evening, at the Casino, a friend
of Maman’s brought him and introduced him to her.
So it all began.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tall against the sky. Out-of-door eyes. Yes, I can
see him.—Don’t call me mademoiselle, Alix; call me
Toppie.—And with his bird-glasses. He would have
been watching birds. I see it all,” said Toppie, her
eyes before her. “And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he came to see us every day. It was of birds
we talked on the first day that he and I and Maman
went for a walk. I knew them a little; not their names;
but their songs and their habits, from having been so
much in the country; whereas Maman is so much the
<span class='it'>parisienne</span> that she was very ignorant and she laughed
at us and said they were all much alike; small, grey
silhouettes in the leaves. And he used to say that I
was like a black-cap and she like a nightingale; though
we did not see those birds at Cannes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” Toppie repeated as Alix paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was still very lame,” said Alix, “so that he
could not play tennis, but he used to come with us and
watch Maman play; she is one of the finest players at
Cannes; did he tell you? It is beautiful to watch her;
she is perhaps at her best when playing tennis. And
he used to write his letters in the garden of our little
villa;—it was lent us, that Autumn, by friends; a
charming little place; he will have told you of it.
He must often have written you letters from the
garden. And he and Maman sat there and read. He
would read to her and she would correct his French,
and she would read to him so that his ear might become
accustomed to the correct accent. And sometimes
it was I who read while he held, I remember, a
skein of silk on his hands for Maman to wind to balls;
lemon-coloured silk for a little jacket she was knitting
me. She is so clever with her fingers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she was so good to him! I know!” Toppie exclaimed,
her eyes still fixed on the distance. “I don’t
know what he would have done with himself if it
hadn’t been for her kindness. He had been so frightfully
lonely there at Cannes. He found it such a dismal
place until you came; perhaps because it is supposed
to be so gay; and that, in war-time, must have
been dreadful. No shade, I remember he said; only
sun and shadows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I remember that he found so much sun depressing,
and that seemed very strange to us, for we
so love the sun. But there was real shade in our garden
under the trees. The fuchsias, too, were in bloom
everywhere, I remember, and I associate them so
much with him; gay, delicate flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fuchsias?” said Toppie. “But that’s a soulless
flower. How strange that he should have been associated
with them in anyone’s mind.—Fuchsias”—she
seemed to be forcing herself to see them, too.
“They grow so much in the Riviera, of course. But I
always think of Owen with daffodils. Our woods are
full of them here in Spring. Fuchsias. Yes? What else?
You all laughed together? Your mother is so gay. He
was happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very happy, I think. We all laughed a great
deal. Maman is not what one would call a gay person;
but she can make gaiety. He teased me a great
deal. I have never cared for dolls and he teased
me about them. He said a girl must be made to care
about dolls, and he bought dreadful little ones with
small feet in painted boots and hid them in my
napkin at dinner or even under my pillow, where I
found them at night. I used to fling them at him—rush
down to the salon where he and Maman sat,
and fling them at him.—For I was already fifteen,
and at that age one is not supposed to care about
dolls, in any case. We had great games, it was a
happy time, in spite of all the sadness. He was a
happy person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy. Yes. A happy person,” Toppie repeated.
She turned her strange shining eyes on Alix. “He
is happy now. He is here, you know. We are not
parted. I feel him every day; always; near me. His
happiness shines round me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was struck to dumbness. She felt afraid. Such
thoughts were so alien to her that she even wondered
if Toppie were quite sane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie went on. “You believe that, too, in your
church, don’t you?—that the dead are near us; not
far away; not shut into a hard golden heaven we
can’t reach; but quite near and caring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have purgatory. I do not understand all these
doctrines. But I am not <span class='it'>dévote</span>,” said Alix after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Purgatory? That’s only a name. That’s only a
symbol, like the golden heaven. And those who have
died, giving their lives for us, will not have to pass
through such an intermediary state.—You are too
young. You have never lost anyone you loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one except my poor grandfather. I always pray
for the repose of his soul. That is what we do in my
church. Is it different in yours? And if they are reposing,
how can they be near us?” Indeed, the thought
of Grand-père as near, in his new, unimaginable state,
was even more disquieting than Toppie herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie seemed to feel that she had drawn her young
companion beyond her depth. She was silent for a moment,
gathering back her thoughts from their search
for sympathy, and she asked, then: “Why do you say
your poor grandfather? Was he unhappy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid he was. Very unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am so sorry. You felt and shared it. I saw
in your face at once, dear little Alix, that you had
shared unhappiness.—You are so young; younger than
your age in one way; yet in another you are so grown
up; it is strange.” Toppie’s eyes mused on her for a
moment. “Why was he unhappy?” she added gently.
“Though, indeed, most people are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was ruined. He had lost everything,” said
Alix. “Montarel, where the Mouverays have always
lived, is sold now, and he knew before he died that
it would be so. And he had lost everyone he loved,
except me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother is not his daughter, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; my father was his son; his only child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you and your mother were often with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only I. He liked having me alone.” Alix did not
require consideration to find an answer. To Giles, in
the train, frankness had been possible; but it was
difficult to repeat such frankness. And Toppie, Alix
felt, was so different from Giles. She would not understand
Maman being divorced as he had. So she evaded
her question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached the Rectory now, and she was
glad not only that they had passed away from Grand-père
and his causes for unhappiness, but from Captain
Owen, too. She would have been sorry to have had to
answer questions about the Paris days when so much
of the brightness had dropped from him. Her memories
of Captain Owen in Paris were all tinged with
sadness; perhaps because the war was so much nearer
in Paris and Captain Owen’s return to it so imminent.
It was as if, in seeing him there with them for his short
leaves, they had seen death always beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will be here when our roses are out,”
said Toppie, in the Rectory garden. “Father and I are
proud of our roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix counted on being back with Maman long before
the time of roses, but she said that she hoped so,
too, and as they passed a window she caught a glimpse
of a tall, bleached man sitting at a writing-table, very
erect, austere, and absorbed; like an old eighteenth-century
print of d’Alembert, Diderot, or some such
erudite wigged gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it’s my father,” said Toppie. “You’ll see
him directly; at tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix stood still for a moment as they entered the
drawing-room. It had everything of charm that the
Bradleys’ drawing-room lacked, except the charm of
cheerfulness, for it was, though so serenely beautiful,
perhaps a little sad. The eighteenth-century panelling
was painted in dim green, and three tall windows at
one side looked out at the garden while, at the other,
was a beautiful fireplace. In the walls were deep niches
filled with rows of old china, and sedate chairs with
backs and seats embroidered in green and dove-colour
were ranged along the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And look at my china roses,” said Toppie, pleased,
Alix saw, by her involuntary pause of pleasure. “Aren’t
they rather wonderful for November? Only smell how
sweet.” And Alix bent over the bowl filled with the
little deep pink roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sedate sofa to match the chairs, with
the tea-table placed as at the Bradleys’; but how different
was this tea. No thick bread-and-butter; no
loaves of cake. Only a plate of little dry biscuits, that
Alix liked, however, and another of bread-and-butter
cut to a wafer-like thinness. And instead of the affectionate
turmoil of Heathside was Toppie’s sweet, chill
voice and Mr. Westmacott’s silence. He drank his tea,
looking, with his crossed legs, which should have been
in buckled knee-breeches, more than ever like d’Alembert;
addressed a courteous question to Alix about her
journey and her mother’s health, and soon went away,
back to his writing-table; but not, Alix felt, to do
much of significance there. He had a tall head and a
meditative eye; but there was something of the sheep
in his appearance, too. If he had had the close curled
wig, that went with his type he would, Alix thought,
have looked very like a silent, dignified sheep that may,
in the meadow, as it looks at you, emit once or twice
a formal baa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie told her that her father was writing a book
on the Stoics. “He has, fortunately, a great deal of
time. It’s a tiny parish; just right for a scholar like my
father; more a scholar than a priest, I sometimes think.
He is rather shy with people and his life here suits him
perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are not Stoics the people who do not mind the
things other people mind?” Alix inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They cared, perhaps, so much for some things that
other things did not hurt,” said Toppie, smiling. “I
don’t know much about them, myself, though; I’m not
at all learned. I’ve never been to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are not learned. One may go to
school and yet not be learned; as you can see from me,”
Alix smiled back. “But I can’t imagine what those
things can be that keep us from being hurt; can
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie looked at her meditatively for a moment.
“You said you were not <span class='it'>dévote</span>; but doesn’t your religion
tell you what things they are?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le bon Dieu</span>, do you mean?” Alix inquired doubtfully.
“<span class='it'>La Sainte Vierge?</span> One’s Guardian Angel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. When you go to church, to confession, aren’t
you told?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are told a great deal; but I am afraid I have
never paid much attention. I only go to confession
once a year. Maman insists on it. I do not like it,”
said Alix. “Had the Stoics a <span class='it'>bon Dieu</span> and a <span class='it'>Sainte
Vierge</span> to console them, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! no!—you very ignorant child!” Toppie
was perforce smiling again, though Alix saw that she
was distressed. “They lived very nobly without our
faith to help them.—In my church we do not have
your beautiful <span class='it'>Sainte Vierge</span> to look to, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Alix. “And I do not understand
why you should leave her out. I like her better than
<span class='it'>le bon Dieu</span>, I must confess. But then rectors could not
feel as we do about a <span class='it'>Sainte Vierge</span>, could they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could one feel like that and be married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you funny child!” Toppie was really laughing,
and Alix, seeing how she amused her, laughed, too.
This was so much better than talking about the dead.—“You
mean a priest could not? We are quite different
about that, too. But I see what you mean”—Toppie’s
eyes dwelt on her—“and sometimes I think
that you are right. I think, perhaps”—Toppie was
grave now—“that the best life could be lived if one
were quite free; with no close human ties. One could
live better for God, and for humanity, then. And we
have nuns in our church, too, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but it is dreadful to be a nun!” Alix exclaimed.
“I had an old great-aunt who was a nun. Grand-père’s
sister. I was always taken to see her in her convent in
Lyon. She came to a <span class='it'>grille</span> and blessed me through it.
She was like a sad old fish in an aquarium. One felt
that her flesh must be cold. It would be death to me,
such a life. And you? Can you really imagine it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not an order like that, that shuts one
quite away,” said Toppie; “but there are nursing and
teaching orders. Yes, I can imagine it. Not while I
have my father; but if I were alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! Do not imagine it!” Alix exclaimed, and
there rose before her the memory of Giles’s face as
he had watched Toppie yesterday evening. “Do not
even imagine it. It is too dreadful. I am sorry that in
your church you have nuns, too. That is foolish of
you, I think, when you need not have them. It is different
for priests. They have to administer the sacraments.
But for a woman it is dreadful. Far, far better
marry and be out in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps.” Toppie was smiling sadly at her, seeing
her, it was evident, as quite a child, yet touched by her
feeling. “But if all question of marrying is over, the
situation alters. You could not understand while you
are so young.—See, Alix, I want you to look at this.”
She moved forward a fire-screen, a square of satin on a
mahogany stand. “Are you interested in needlework?
French girls do it so beautifully, I know. My mother
embroidered this. She copied it from those old chairbacks.
Do look at them. Her grandmother did those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The screen, on a background of pearly satin, had two
doves in a basket, entwined with laurel; and the chairs,
in a softer, sadder key, repeated them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are beautiful,” said Alix. It seemed to her,
as she looked at the gentle doves, that the dead, in
Toppie’s drawing-room, joined pale hands around her
and whispered: “We are here.” But it was so sad.
The doves nestling side by side, so confident of love,
made her think of all the partings of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My great-grandmother was married to a soldier,”
said Toppie, “and went out to India and died there
when my grandfather was born. She did all those
chairs while she was waiting for his birth. She was
only twenty-one. I often think of her; so young; stitching
her thoughts of home, her hopes for her baby—the
past and the future—into the embroidery. And
one feels how happy she must have been in her marriage
to have chosen that design. My poor great-grandfather
brought all her things back to England,
with his little boy.—That funny little water-colour
sketch is of him, in his frilled cap; with his ayah.—And
he grew up to be a soldier, too, and was killed, out
in India, fighting a frontier tribe. My mother was his
only child. I was fourteen when she died. How happy
you are to have your mother, Alix. She makes beautiful
things, too. I shan’t forget the little lemon silk
jacket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s sense of sadness had deepened while Toppie
spoke. So different Toppie’s past; so different Toppie’s
mother, she felt sure: and the sense of sadness
was in the difference. An abyss seemed to lie between
her and Toppie, an abyss that Toppie did not see and
could not, perhaps, even imagine. She could not place
Toppie against any of the backgrounds familiar to her.
She could not see her in Maman’s salon, unless as one
of those dim evasive figures, the “Misses” of her childhood,
someone dressed differently, hovering diffidently
and helping with the tea and cakes. She could see Toppie
in Maman’s salon as her governess, but in no other
capacity. Toppie would not understand anything said
there, or would not care to understand. She would
draw away from the shining soap-bubble. She would
look with cold dismay at madame Gérardin and mademoiselle
Fontaine. It was sad to feel fond of someone
and to feel them fond of you, and yet to see that only
here, among her doves, could their worlds touch at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was growing dark, and Toppie said that she
would take her home, and, in the hall, lighted a
little lantern for the walk across the common. They
had gone halfway when they saw, in the distance,
another lantern advancing towards them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Giles,” said Toppie, pausing. “He has come
for you. So I will go back. I have some letters to
finish for the post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come to meet him. He will, I am sure, be glad
of a word with you,” said Alix. She felt sure that it
had been in the hope of a word with Toppie rather than
to fetch herself that Giles had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we have so many words; every day; all our
lives long,” said Toppie, and, though she continued to
advance, Alix felt a slight constraint in her voice. “He
is a dear, is he not, Giles?” she added, as if irrelevantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a dear!” said Alix. “I felt him that at once.
And so good; and so intelligent.”—“More intelligent
than Captain Owen; more good,” was in her mind.
But that made, she knew, no difference. People were
not loved for their intelligence, or their goodness,
either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great dear, Giles,” Toppie repeated, but with no
intention, evidently, of being urged by her young companion’s
warmth beyond her own sense of due commendation.
“Owen loved him devotedly. After his
mother it was Giles he loved best of all his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were all three of the same <span class='it'>pâte</span>, were they
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pâte?</span>” Toppie questioned. Her French was not
quite so good as Giles’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The paste, you know, of which earthenware or porcelain
is made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Yes. And Owen was porcelain; and Giles is
earthenware; and dear Mrs. Bradley is both together.”
Toppie mused on the simile with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it did not satisfy Alix. “Some earthenware is
very rare and precious; tough and fine at once. And
it wears and wears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it never has the beauty,” said Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was now within speaking distance, and by the
light of their lantern Alix saw that his eyes were fixed
upon Toppie with an indefinable expression; not alarm;
not inquiry; but a steady watchfulness that, to her perception,
controlled these feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid you’d run away with our young guest
and came out to look for you,” he said. “It’s six
o’clock.” While Alix, feeling a soft touch on her glove,
looked down to see the earnest, illumined eyes of Jock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t realize it was so late,” said Toppie, and to
Alix’s ear the tone of her voice was altered. Toppie,
for all her familiarity, would never, she felt, have talked
with any of the Bradleys as she had with her this afternoon.
“We’ve talked and talked; haven’t we, Alix. I
must fly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in for a little. Mother’s just back. She’d
love to see you,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, I can’t. Give her my love. I’ll drop
in upon her to-morrow afternoon, after my class.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll go back with you, then. It’s late for
you to be out alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me! On the common! How absurd you are,
Giles! Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night,” said Giles. He showed no grievance;
some shade, rather, seemed lifted from him, and in a
moment, as he and she walked on together, Alix divined
that his anxiety had been lest she had said anything to
hurt Toppie or revived memories that cut too deep.
It had not been so much to see Toppie as to watch over
her that he had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lantern made a soft round of light into which
they advanced and the November air was pleasant.
“And what have you talked and talked about?” Giles
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All sorts of things,” said Alix. She was glad to feel
that she could give him fuller relief. “Her great-grandmother’s
embroideries and the Stoics and <span class='it'>la
Sainte Vierge</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>La Sainte Vierge!</span>” said Giles, and he laughed. Yes,
actually, he was speaking with her of the enshrined
Toppie and she had made him laugh. “What did you
have to say about <span class='it'>la Sainte Vierge</span>, pray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Alix paused. She saw that she had perhaps
taken a wrong turn, but it was best to go on as though
she did not think so. “It was of religion and <span class='it'>le Paradis</span>,
you see; and whether the dead are with us here. Do
you, too, think that they are, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dead! With us here!—Oh. Yes, I see.”
Giles, after his exclamations of surprise, lapsed for a
moment into silence. “She must like you very much,
Alix, to talk to you about that,” he said presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she does like me. He liked me. It would
always be that for Toppie, wouldn’t it? And then I
can give her more about him. We talked of that, too.
Things she didn’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt Giles’s eyes turn down towards her. He contemplated
her as they walked forward. “What sort of
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How we met him. How he looked. What we
all did together. She loved hearing; but especially
that he was happy. And it is that she feels. That he
is with her now; and happy. Do you believe it, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles walked on beside her in the darkness that was
not yet quite dark, the light melted into it so softly
and went so far. Alix could see Bobby racing on ahead.
Jock went just before them, and Amy followed meekly,
her nose at Giles’s heels. It was easy to talk together
in the melting darkness, and she must have given Giles
a great deal to think about, for he said nothing for a
long time. Then, as if he brought his thoughts back to
her and her question with an effort, he said: “It doesn’t
follow, because we’re dead, that we’re happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we are not happy in purgatory; and according
to the church we must all go to purgatory, unless we
have been great saints. She asked me about my religion.
And we have purgatory, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you didn’t say anything about it that may
have troubled her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I said nothing at all that troubled her,” Alix
assured him. “She did not take purgatory at all
seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you?” Giles was smiling a little. How much
relief she had given him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid not,” Alix owned. “I am afraid I
do not take heaven seriously either. But I did not
tell her that. It might have grieved her. It always
seems to me that we must go out like blown candles,
when we are dead. I do not like to think it; but it
seems so to me. Does it not to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it doesn’t. You are a little pagan, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pagan! Not at all! I am a Catholic. I go to confession
once a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles now laughed out. So much had she relieved
him that her unspiritual state roused only mirth in
him. “Doesn’t your confessor give you any penances?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I have penances. I do them as I am told. The
<span class='it'>Chemin de la Croix</span>—all round the church.—It is
very tiring—dragging my <span class='it'>prie dieu</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles went on laughing;—“Is it? By Jove! And
your first communion? Weren’t you prepared for
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But that was five years ago. I was only a
child then. I have altered my opinion of many things
since then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much Giles found her still a child she heard in
his laughter as he asked on: “But what right have you
to say you aren’t a pagan? What right have you to
call yourself a Catholic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been baptized,” said Alix. “I have been
confirmed. I go to confession, and to Mass, at least at
Easter. Most certainly I am a Catholic. You might
as well say I was not French because I did not believe
in the Republic as to say I am not a Catholic because
I don’t believe in heaven. One is, or one is not. It is a
question of being born so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. I see.” Giles was looking down at her, so
amused, yet also, she felt, touched by what she said.
They entered the little door in the garden-wall.
“There’s something to be said for that way of looking
at it,” he owned. “It puts it neatly. It explains all
sorts of things, in Catholicism and in France. You are
a wonderful people, Alix.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Of all her new experiences Alix most enjoyed “The
Messiah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village choir was a feeble enough little affair, its
energy concentrated in Giles’s disciplined, sustaining
baritone and the robust sopranos of Ruth, Rosemary,
and the postmistress. The tenors were almost non-existent,
and the altos, among whom Alix was placed at
once, terribly weak. But the doctor’s daughter, at the
piano, accompanied so accurately, Mrs. Bradley, gentle
and absorbed, with her wand, conducted so carefully,
that it was a pleasure to sing, and the grave exultant
music wove itself deeply into Alix’s impressions
of the new life. It made her think of Giles and of his
mother, and of Toppie, too. It seemed to go with them;
just as it seemed to go with the walk home by lantern-light,
and even with the cheerful family supper afterwards
where Giles boiled eggs over the fire, and Mrs.
Bradley made cocoa on a spirit-lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The High School, to which she and Ruth and Rosemary
bicycled every day, was at once familiar and
alien. It was like the <span class='it'>Lycée</span>, in shape, as it were; but
not in texture. Hockey could not give it the flavour
that it lacked. The girls, all of them, were too much
like Ruth and Rosemary. They lived, she felt, in what
they did, not in what they thought. They had a sense
of fun, but no sense of irony, and with their sharp-cut
edges, their hardy colour, they seemed to repel any
suggestion of mystery, in life or in themselves. They
accepted her at once. They seemed to like her, just as
Ruth and Rosemary did. But she felt that anybody
else who could hold a hockey stick and tell the truth
would have done just as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Christmas holidays Jack and Francis came
home from school. Heathside seethed with noise, pets
and handicrafts. Giles, now demobilized, was preparing
for his return to Oxford after Christmas. He went
up and down to London a good deal and she had the
sensation of having lost him; of being relegated by him
to the family group. One day, however, he came into
the dining-room while she was trying to write a letter
on a corner of the table. It was only in the dining-room
that a fire was lighted in the mornings, and Jack and
Francis were carpentering at one end, while Ruth cut
out blouses in the middle. It was difficult to try to tell
Maman about “The Messiah” in such surroundings,
and though she liked Jack and Francis so much she
could not bring herself to like the white rat that ambled
heavily about among the tools and <span class='it'>crêpe de Chine</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, that’s not much of a place for letter-writing,”
Giles remarked. “Come to my study, Alix. I’m a favoured
person and have a gas-fire going all morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s going out with us directly, to see our ferrets!”
shouted Jack and Francis. They were dear little
boys; Francis brown, like Giles, and Jack fair like his
sisters. Oddly, enough, with all their uproar, Alix felt
them gentler, more respectful of one’s identity, than
Ruth and Rosemary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to see the ferrets, Alix?” Giles inquired.
“Are you fond of ferrets?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not like what I hear of them,” said Alix. “But
cats, too, do dreadful things; and one loves cats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll defy anyone to love a ferret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not going to let her see the rabbiting. She
says she doesn’t want to, though she misses a lot. It’s
far kinder than traps. Bobby kills them in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I do not want to see that. But will after lunch
do for ferrets? I would rather finish my letters now,”
Alix owned. And though she was sorry to disappoint
Jack and Francis, it was with a sense of escape that
she followed Giles out of the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The study was small, warm, and untidy. Under an
ugly mantelpiece of carved oak was a bright little gas-fire,
looking like incandescent dried apples, and on the
mantelpiece were ranged pipes, family photographs,
and quite a menagerie of small animal ornaments which
Alix guessed to be family presents. There was a small
metal bear on his hind legs holding spills in his arms,
a horrible china cow, yellow with red spots and a
place in her back for matches, and a foolish puppy in
black velvet with a red flannel tongue and one ear that
went up and one that went down. A very grubby and
irrelevant statuette of Venus de Milo stood among
them and Alix felt sorry for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold my jewels!” said Giles with a grin. “Francis
gave me that monster when he was three; that’s
from Jack and that from Rosemary. The Venus is an
effort of Ruth’s; brought to me from Paris. Everything
you see there is either Christmas or birthdays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very faithful to your anniversaries,” said
Alix, smiling. “What a nice photograph of your
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it?” said Giles, pleased. “You like my
mother, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like all your family,” said Alix politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, in a way, you’d like them all,”
said Giles. “But I am afraid they rather wear you out.
There are so many of them and they are so young and
vigorous. You must take refuge here when they dash
over you too much. I’ll do my reading, and you can
read or write or meditate, as you like. I shan’t speak
to you and you mustn’t speak to me. I’ve noticed you
are a kid who can keep still. We shall get on capitally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was arranged, and as Alix took her place at the
little writing-table he pulled forward for her, she noticed
that there were many books along two sides of
the room and along the other a row of large framed
photographs of Greek and Sicilian temples that more
than atoned for the mantelpiece. When she did not
feel like reading or writing, she would look at those.
They made her think, in the sense of space and tranquillity
and splendour they gave her, of Montarel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first mornings of her withdrawal there mingled
with her sense of security an apprehension of the
unsaid things that lay between her and Giles and that
might still have to be said; but this grew less with every
day. It became quite evident that Giles was going to
say nothing. Perhaps, indeed, she had imagined something
of the trouble and confusion she had felt in him
at their first meeting. Perhaps in some odd, twisted
way, it had all been because of Toppie; because the
sight of her brought back so vividly the memory of the
dead brother and of Toppie’s loss. Whatever it had
been, she did not think he would ever show it to her
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She owed more than the peaceful mornings to him.
He seemed to restore Maman to her. Now, at last, she
could really tell Maman, with a mind composed, how
surprised Mrs. Bradley had been at hearing that she
wore a linen chemise next her skin and felt no need of
wool; how like a dignified sheep was Toppie’s father;
how strange the sense of growing strength the choruses
of “The Messiah” gave one, like a sort of calisthenic.
And how Mrs. Bradley had taken her up to London to
choose a delightful winter outfit; woollen jumpers,
ribbed stockings, and a winter coat and hat. Alix told
Maman all about this and about the fat, jovial old
lady with short grey hair with whom they had had tea
in Kensington, a friend of Mrs. Bradley’s father and a
public speaker. Some things, however, she did not tell
her. She gave no account of Toppie’s beliefs in regard
to Captain Owen, and, a lesser matter, yet significant,
she had never yet satisfied Maman as to the social
status of her new friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was because Giles sat there, his pipe between
his teeth, his feet propped up against the mantelpiece,
his hand, as he perused the tome upon his knees,
raised now and then to rub his hair on end, that it
seemed so irrelevant to write about such things. After
all what business was it of Maman’s? She had had no
further use for them than that they should warm and
feed her child during a hard winter; what difference
did their status make to her? It was true that she and
Maman had always shared impressions to the last
crumb of analysis, and it was with a slight sense of
<span class='it'>malice</span> that she thus withheld from her the crumb for
which she asked more than once. “Who are they?
What are they, <span class='it'>ma chérie</span>?” Maman, from Cannes, inquired.
“The <span class='it'>train de vie</span> you described seems that of
the true <span class='it'>confort anglais</span>; but, apparently, there is no
elegance. What are their <span class='it'>relations</span>? Do they go at all
<span class='it'>dans le monde</span>? Is there a <span class='it'>vie de château</span> in the neighbourhood?
I am interested in all you have to tell me
of these excellent people.” Naturally. But though
Alix might not have felt it unmeet, a month ago, to
tell Maman all this, she would have felt it unmeet now.
How funny Giles would have thought it if he had
known that she sat there informing Maman that his
family did not go <span class='it'>dans le monde</span> at all, in the sense that
Maman meant by <span class='it'>le monde</span>; and that they were decidedly
of the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>. It was not that Maman was
wrong in wanting to know, or that Giles would have
been right in thinking that <span class='it'>le monde</span> didn’t matter. It
was simply that she did not care to write in that way
to Maman about him and his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maman, meanwhile, was evidently enjoying many
<span class='it'>relations</span>; dancing, dining, playing tennis, entertaining
her friends. There were important names in her letters
and Alix sometimes meditated a little over them.
When she did not write or read, she meditated Giles’s
Greek temples and Maman’s <span class='it'>relations</span>. The important
names, in the world of art and letters—but that was
not the world Maman meant in asking about the Bradleys—were
male and female; in the world of fashion,
male only. It was the marquis and the prince; but
never the marquise and the princesse. Why? Alix wondered.
Did Maman find the wives of fashion dull?
But if one didn’t know them, too, could one be said to
be <span class='it'>dans le vrai grand monde</span>? She knew how Maman’s
gay, sombre eyes would meet the question (not that it
was one that Alix would ever dream of putting to her):
“<span class='it'>Je suis du monde qui me plaît, ma chérie.</span>” But Alix
was not quite sure that this was true. She was not sure
that Maman’s indifference was as securely grounded
as Giles’s. Perhaps real indifference only came from
reading so much Plato and Aristotle. Yet she herself,
who did not read Plato, was indifferent. It was only in
regard to Maman that she was not indifferent, and perhaps
it was true that it was only in regard to herself
that Maman was not. Poor, beloved, beautiful Maman;
and wronged; deeply wronged, Alix felt sure. Always,
when she thought of her, her heart expanded in
love and then contracted in anxiety. She saw her as a
wild, lovely creature caught in a trap and only escaping
maimed for life. She could not range as far and
as freely as the unmaimed creatures; dimly Alix saw
that, as the explanation of what was ambiguous in
her position. She had lost the full liberty hers by
birth and instinct. Yet, despite the limitations of
her misfortune, she had every right to her own
standards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judged by Maman’s standards Alix could not conceal
from herself that the Bradleys were very undistinguished.
Maman would have hated the bounteous,
graceless meals; Mrs. Bradley sitting at breakfast
among the noise and porridge and kippers, heaped
round with letters and circulars, reading an appeal for
crippled babies while she poured out the tea and coffee
and oftener than not slopping it into the saucer. “Oh,
I’m <span class='it'>so</span> sorry, dear,” she would exclaim; but Maman
would have commented, dryly, that a woman so much
occupied had better breakfast in bed and get through
her correspondence out of sight. Maman could be terribly
dry about disorder and gracelessness. Alix had
never forgotten the terse and accurate reproofs that
her own lapses in these respects had called down upon
her in her childhood. As for the uproarious children,
“<span class='it'>Ces marmots-là ne sonts pas appétissants</span>,” was what
Maman would have said of Ruth and Rosemary, taking
their ease during the holidays and padding from
sideboard to table in shabby bedroom slippers, while
Jack and Francis had already got their hands dirty.
Alix could not see Maman at that breakfast-table; but
then there was no need to try to. She would never have
come down at all to breakfast, and Alix could not really
think of anything later in the day that she would have
thought it worth while to come down to. A drive with
Giles in the car, perhaps. She would have liked Giles.
She would have liked him, perhaps, as much as she had
liked Captain Owen. But as for the rest of the family,
she would have found them only fit for the happy task
of warming, feeding, and clothing her child. “<span class='it'>Trop
honorée</span>,” Maman might even remark, in the mood of
mirthful impertinence she could display. Maman’s impertinencies
usually amused Alix; but she did not want
to see them evoked, ever, by the Bradleys. It hurt her
to think of it. Already she was too fond of them.
Maman must never come to Heathside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas was now close upon them, and the house,
like a mysterious boiling pot, bubbled with happy
secrets. Francis came to lunch unaware of the strip of
gold paper gummed to his nose; Ruth and Rosemary
sat hunched in corners working surreptitiously at belated
pieces of knitting. Giles went up to London with
his mother for a day’s shopping and came back in the
evening with parcels hanging from every finger, and
she and Toppie had a wonderful day there, for Mrs.
Bradley had given her pocket-money to spend on presents
and some had come from Maman, too, so that
there was a real meaning for her in the long indecisions
over crowded counters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix usually went over to the Rectory to work at her
presents with Toppie. She was making a tea-cloth for
Mrs. Bradley and embroidering monograms, that elicited
Toppie’s admiration, on fine handkerchiefs for
Ruth and Rosemary; and she had found the right
books for the boys and a silver pencil for Giles. Toppie
had a beautiful cushion for his chair at Oxford, and
Toppie, too, had thought of Maman. Alix almost felt
the tears rise to her eyes when she showed her the little
frame of blue and silver she had embroidered enclosing
a snapshot of Alix herself, standing at the edge of the
wood with the dogs about her. She had not expected
anyone to think of Maman. Maman, she knew, would
not think of them. And then Christmas was different
in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maman, all the same, remembered that it was
specially kept in England. It was on Christmas Day
itself, and not on the <span class='it'>Nouvel An</span> as Alix had expected,
that the long parcel, brought over by a friend of
Maman’s, arrived for her from Cannes. Already she
had had more presents than ever before in her life. A
toilet-set from Mrs. Bradley; a writing-case from
Giles; a scarf from Ruth, and a pair of stockings from
Rosemary; from Jack a neat penknife, and from Francis
a box of small brightly coloured handkerchiefs that
were obviously what a little boy would admire. All the
distributions took place at the breakfast-table, and
Maman’s parcel had not yet arrived when Alix unrolled
from its tissue-paper Toppie’s gift, and saw, in a tiny
box of faded leather, the beautiful little old brooch, an
emerald surrounded by pearls. It made her think at
once of the doves and the laurel wreath and of Toppie’s
great-grandmother; of the past, brooded upon; never
forgotten. She gazed at it in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>say</span>!” Ruth exclaimed. They had all crowded
round her to look. “She used to wear that. It belonged
to some ancestress. She must be most awfully
fond of you to give it to you, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix met Giles’s eyes looking down at the brooch
over their heads. She felt that she had gained in value
for him from Toppie’s fondness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was after all this excitement that the post
brought Maman’s box and that the many wrappings
of tissue-paper disclosed the most exquisite of evening
dresses; white taffeta; crisp, supple, silvery; girdled
with small white roses and their green leaves. The little
card pinned to the breast said: “<span class='it'>A ma chérie lointaine</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw anything so lovely!” said Rosemary,
and Alix felt a wave of warmth for Rosemary go
through her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too beautiful,” said Mrs. Bradley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She made it herself, I am sure,” said Alix. “It is
wonderful how she makes these lovely things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was looking at her again. His look was different.
It was as if her pride in Maman touched him
as much as Toppie’s brooch had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so much too pretty for anything you do here,
isn’t it, dear,” said Mrs. Bradley. “I think we must
have a little dance when Giles comes home for the
Easter holidays, so that you can wear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mummy!” cried Ruth and Rosemary. Rosemary
had never yet been to a real dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have new dresses then, too,” said Ruth.
“Pink’s my colour, and blue’s Rosemary’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can’t I wear pink, too? Toppie wears blue
in the evenings,” Rosemary objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why shouldn’t you both wear blue? I don’t
like to see sisters dressed alike. Besides, will Toppie
come?” Ruth wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe she will, for Alix’s sake,” said Mrs. Bradley.
“This will be Alix’s dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blue will be much more becoming to you, really,
Rosemary, with your golden hair,” Alix assured her
younger friend, who was looking a little sulky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you must go and see if you can persuade Toppie
to say she’ll come, Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix saw how much Mrs. Bradley hoped that Toppie
would consent, and Giles, his hands in his pockets,
walked away to the window and looked out. “And
how happy it would make Giles to see her in blue
again,” she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all going for tea to the Rectory next day,
but though it was stormy Alix put on her raincoat and
made her way across the common that very afternoon.
So familiar was that path now, so familiar the old gardener,
in holiday attire to-day, touching his hat and
wishing her a happy Christmas, and then Toppie’s face
of welcome at the door, for, seeing her from above,
Toppie herself ran down to open to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How sweet of you to come! There’s just time to
see you between services. Come in. Happy Christmas,
dear child!” said Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Toppie—the emerald! Never have I had so
beautiful an ornament!” Alix exclaimed while Toppie
helped her strip off the streaming coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And never have I seen a little box as beautiful
as yours,” said Toppie, leading her into the drawing-room.
Alix had made for Toppie a little satin box and
had carefully copied the doves in the laurel-wreathed
basket upon it. “It’s too beautifully done,” said Toppie.
“How did you manage from memory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I drew the doves one day, quickly, when you went
out, and the colours are easy to carry in one’s head. I
am glad you like it. I am so fond of little boxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I. I love them. I never can have too many
of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was lighted in the drawing-room, and in the
soft obscurity Toppie with her high golden head looked
like a tall white lighted <span class='it'>cierge</span>; a Christmas <span class='it'>cierge</span> in a
votive chapel of a great cathedral; for though so sweet,
so almost gay, the background to Toppie’s gaiety was
something dedicated and remote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine are not very exact. They are too big for the
basket,” said Alix, looking at the doves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like them the more for that. I love the way they
overflow,” said Toppie. “Alix, can you guess what I
have put in your box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were sitting on the sofa, side by side, and Toppie’s
eyes, sweet, austere, were on her. “His letters
from France. All the letters about you and your
mother.” Alix had not needed to be told. She had
guessed from Toppie’s look. “They just fit it,” said
Toppie. “As if it had been made for them.” And,
leaning forward, she kissed Alix lightly on the forehead.
It felt a little to Alix as though the Virgin in the
votive chapel had stooped down from her altar to kiss
one. It was sweet; and it was also a little frightening.
There was always something about Toppie that almost
frightened her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Toppie,” she said presently. “I have come
about something very important. I had from Maman
this morning the very dress to go with your brooch;
green and white; the loveliest dress. And Mrs. Bradley
says they will have a dance at Easter so that I can
wear it. And what we all hope is that you will be there.
You will come, will you not, Toppie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was looking at her with her cold sweet look
and it did not alter as she smiled and said: “Of course
I’ll come; and sit with Mrs. Bradley and look at you
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you would dance, Toppie? And wear pale
blue? It is your colour they say, and I have only seen
you in grey. You must be very lovely in blue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I?” Toppie still smiled, and Alix had long
since divined her to be invulnerable to praise. She
wore her grey to-day; her Sunday grey; and her white
neck and throat, unfreckled, were so fair that, imagining
her in blue, Alix saw her as a birch-tree against the
pale spring sky. But with the cold yet loving look she
shook her head and said: “No; I won’t dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Toppie—No? Do you mean never?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” said Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can say that? When you are so young?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t need a promise, you know,” said Toppie.
“I don’t have to take a pledge. Some things are for
one time and some things for another. That time is
past. But I’ll come to the dance, of course, and love
seeing you all; and grey, really, has always been my
colour more than blue. I’ve always worn grey,” said
Toppie, smiling; and she went on, leaving that subject
very definitely disposed of: “Tell me what you have
all been doing since I saw you. Tying up parcels?
Your box was so prettily tied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like ribbons on <span class='it'>étrennes</span>. And green ribbon seems
to go with Christmas and snow and fir-trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth and Rosemary had old knotted string round
their parcels, poor dears, and brown paper,” Toppie
remarked. She always showed a certain kindly ruthlessness
in her allusions to the Bradley sisters and Alix
sometimes wondered what, if she had married their
brother, their relations with their gentle but inflexible
sister-in-law would have been. They admired Toppie;
they feared her, a very little, for they were not of a
nature to feel fear easily; but they did not love her.
Already, strange though that was, they were far fonder
of herself than of Toppie, and took her for granted as
part of the family pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a desperation at the end—for string! And
all the shops shut,” said Alix. “I bought my ribbon
long ago. I had such nice presents from Ruth and
Rosemary. Such patience it must take, to go down two
whole stockings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good girls,” said Toppie. “And Giles gave you the
writing-case.” Her voice in speaking of Giles was so
much kinder than when he was there—to be kept
away. Alix always felt a little rise of indignation on
Giles’s account when she heard it. It was not as if
Giles ever tried to draw near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a delightful writing-case. I keep finding new
wonderful flaps and pockets in it. Everything is remembered.
And a fountain pen, too. I have never
had one before. It makes one’s thoughts come so much
more easily if one does not have to dip in the middle
of them. I wrote to Maman with it this morning, when
they were all at church. It is very happy for me, being
there with Giles in his study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told me that you were one of the very few people
he could imagine having who wouldn’t disturb
him,” said Toppie. “He said you were the most peaceful
person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he? I am so glad. I like so very much being
there— Toppie,” she found herself saying quite suddenly,
“Giles is the kindest person in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie looked at her. “Have you only just found
that out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I knew it the first time I saw him, I think. But
he is more than that,” said Alix, feeling the inadequacy
of the word. “He is good. Because he understands.
Some people are only good because they do not understand.
You know what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly,” Toppie nodded, grave and gentle.
“You see things more clearly than most people, Alix.
That is one of the reasons I am so fond of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see them as clearly as Giles does. Giles
would see everything and never fail. It is his courage.
The more there was to see, the more there was to bear,
the more he would be standing there beside you.” It
was strange to her, as she spoke, to feel how deeply she
knew all this about Giles, though she had never before
formulated it to herself. And she added: “And never
would he ask for anything for himself, Toppie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie considered her, arrested, it was evident; perhaps
a little surprised. “Have you and Giles talked a
great deal? Dear Giles. All that you say is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we have talked very little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie continued to observe her. “You can’t talk
too much with him,” she said after a little silence.
“You can’t see too much of him. He’s a rock, Alix,
and you can build on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, too, can build on him, Toppie,” said Alix at
this. Something changed in Toppie’s look at that. It
was withdrawal rather than reproof that Alix felt as
Toppie said: “I have built on Giles for years. We have
known each other for a very long time, you see, Alix.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was only a few days after Christmas that a dreadful
thing happened to Alix; the most dreadful thing that
had ever happened to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all in the drawing-room after dinner—all
except Francis and Jack who had gone to bed;—Ruth
writing, Rosemary altering a blouse and Giles
reading in his accustomed place. Alix sat beside Mrs.
Bradley on the sofa, turned sideways while she held a
skein of wool for her to wind, and she was never to forget
the look of that heather-coloured wool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley suddenly, “how was it
that Owen didn’t see you when he went to Paris on
leave?—that one leave he had; in February last winter.
You must have been away, I think, for he said
nothing of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix sat there, holding up the wool, and, even as she
faced Mrs. Bradley thus, steadying eyes and lips and
hands, she was aware, though she could only see him
as a blurred form, that Giles, suddenly, was watching
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Owen’s leave! His one leave! He had come
to Paris three times in that last winter, and the last
had been in April only a fortnight before his death.
And he had never told his family! Why had he not
told them? Why! Why! The clamour of her thoughts
seemed so to fill her ears that it was like sinking in the
sea. She had the sensation of drowning, yet of keeping
calm while she drowned, resourceful, even as she measured
her calamity, and she heard her own voice speaking
from far above her it seemed—while beneath Mrs.
Bradley’s eyes, beneath Giles’s, her thoughts raced
swiftly, swiftly;—“Yes; we should, of course, have
seen him, but we were away; we were away in the
country at that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Cannes, I suppose,” said Mrs. Bradley. “What
a pity for Owen. How lonely he must have been. He
hadn’t time to come home, you see; only the two days.
And he knew nobody in Paris except the old professor’s
family, where Ruth and Rosemary stayed before
the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we were not at Cannes; we had gone to the
sea in Normandy,” said Alix. It was in her tradition,
that an emergency should find one resourceful, yet,
had she had time for the reflection, her own swiftness
in resource might now have surprised herself. “Maman
has a little house on the coast that we sometimes go to,
but that she usually lets. We depend very much on
letting it every summer. We went that time in February
to put it in order for the spring. It could not be
helped; tenants were coming early,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity,” Mrs. Bradley repeated sadly. “Or
if only he could have managed to go to you there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be sure that we wired at once and suggested
it; but the time was too short,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she was able, since Mrs. Bradley said no more,
to come to the surface, alive and apparently uninjured,
but to her own consciousness floating like a helpless,
battered object. Something dreadful had happened to
her; she knew that; and to Maman; and to them all.
But she could not see it clearly. Only by degrees, as
Mrs. Bradley wound her last loops of wool and said,
“Thank you, dear,” and her hands could fold again in
her lap, did it come to her that the dreadful thing was
something that Captain Owen had done; and most of
all to Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been with them; staying with them; three
times; the cherished friend; and he had never told his
family. She sat there, very still, and tried to think
why it could have been, and the picture that came to
her was of Captain Owen sitting on one side of the fire
in the little salon of the rue de Penthièvre; sitting as
Giles now sat; looking across at Maman who, her finger
in the pages of a half-closed book, returned his gaze
with a strange sadness. And from this picture, lifting
her eyes, she met Giles’s fixed upon her and saw that
Giles knew, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked back at him. All she could do was to
look. To pretend not to see that he knew, to look away
while she pretended, would only be to reveal more
glaringly to him her sense of their mutual misfortune.
Giles, too, knew that Captain Owen had been with
them in Paris; he would not have looked at her like
that if he had not known; with that dark and heavy
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say!” groaned Rosemary, stretching herself
out in her chair with a wide yawn of fatigue, “why was
I such a fool as to take out this sleeve! It was well
enough long, and I’ll never get it in properly again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you to cut it kimono shape; you’d have had
no trouble then,” said Ruth. “Where’s your house in
Normandy, Alix? We were in Houlegate, years ago,
when we were kids. I never thought of you in Normandy
somehow. Only in Cannes, among the orange-trees
you know, romantic child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is at Vaudettes-sur-Mer,” said Alix. “I like
Normandy better than the Riviera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard of Vaudettes-sur-Mer,” said Ruth.
“Is it pretty? Has it got a sandy beach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it is <span class='it'>galets</span>, not sand; not until the tide is low;
and Vaudettes is up on the cliff so that one has a
long climb down to get to it. But the village is very
pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most French seaside villas are such hideous gimcrack
things; worse than ours, I always think. Is your
house an old one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; quite old; quite unspoiled. There are no
modern villas yet at Vaudettes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to bed, dear?” Mrs. Bradley asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I’m going to read in my room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do we make too much noise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little too much. Good-night everybody,” said
Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How tired Giles looks,” said Mrs. Bradley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s grinding too hard at his work,” said Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix felt that it was not his work. Giles, too, had
had a blow; and he was angry with her; darkly, heavily
angry; why she could not tell. Only her heart swelled
with a suffocating sense of resentment and of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not go to the study next morning. She had
thought and thought in the night, and she saw now
that if Giles knew something that she knew, he also
knew something she did not know. She was afraid of
Giles and his knowledge; afraid of what they might
have to say to each other. And she was angry with
him, too, for making her afraid. Pain, dark and mysterious,
pain that seemed to have come to her from his
eyes, pressed upon her. And it made her think of the
suffering that Grand-père’s eyes had conveyed; and of
Maman. What she feared was that he would speak to
her of Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not go; but Giles came to her. She was curled
up in her scarf on the sofa in the cold drawing-room,
and it made her think of the time that she had waited
at Victoria and Giles had been so late. He was not late
now; he was early; and he said at once, making no
pretence about it: “Come, please, I want to talk to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had felt herself angry with Giles, because of the
injustice of his anger towards herself; but as she faced
him in the study, the grey January morning outside
the window, the gas-fire creaking in its dismal mirth
in the grate, her anger went down. She felt pity
for him. He, too, had not slept; he, too, had had a
horrible night; and if he looked at her thus sternly it
was, she saw, more because he was suffering than because
he was angry. He stood before her, his hands
thrust deeply in his pockets, and what he said was:
“Look here, Alix, were you lying last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astonishment almost bereft her of breath. Lying?
Could he have thought it possible that she was not
lying? Could he have thought it possible—turning it
over and over in his mind during the night—that she
did not know about Captain Owen’s leaves? It flashed
across her that, if she could find another lie, now, for
him, and say that she had not been lying, he might believe
her. He would have no knowledge with which to
contradict that lie. But, while she looked at him, feeling
her face getting whiter and whiter, what strangely
came to her was that she could not lie to Giles. It was
better to share whatever pain there was to be shared
with him than to be shut out, with her lie, in loneliness,
if in safety. So, keeping her eyes on him, in a steady
voice she said: “Yes. I was lying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles at this contemplated her for a long time and it
seemed to be with deep thoughtfulness rather than
with any other feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I not?” asked Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you not?—You can invent such a
story, in every detail, and then come and ask me how
not? What in Heaven’s name do you mean?” said
Giles. “Have you no sense of truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother did not know. Captain Owen never
told your mother.” Alix’s voice was trembling, for she
heard the emotion in his. “Would you have had me
say to her, after he had kept silence, that he had been
with us three times in Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles’s expression altered. “Three times?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Three. Not the once she thought. That time
in February was the first. He came twice afterwards.
You did not know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Giles, “I didn’t know that. I thought it
was only the once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped. He stopped for a long time after saying
this and suddenly she saw the blood mounting to his
face. He became, slowly, crimson. He did not know
what to say. Oh, poor Giles, what was this horrible
perplexity that so darkened his good face when all that
he had to tell her, when it finally came, was so simple?
“I wasn’t in the same part of the front as he was. I
didn’t follow what he did. It was by chance that I saw
him in Paris, that time in February. I had a leave, too.
And I saw him there, walking in the Bois with your
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had seen Maman! Alix felt herself grow dim
with perplexity. She looked about her and sank down
on a chair before her little writing-table. “Did you
not speak to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t speak to them.” Giles stood there, in
his helplessness, before her. “I thought they wanted
to be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Maman would so have wished to know you.
I do not see why you did not speak. Yes. I remember
that they went to the Bois. He was with us all the
time, you see. He stayed with us,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Giles. How overwhelming was his plight!
Could shame for his brother’s inexplicable duplicity,
shame for his own strange silence, that day in the
Bois, account for such confusion? “Yes. I was
afraid you were lying,” was all he found to mutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you knew. You knew, and yet you kept it
from your mother. It was for her sake that you kept it
from her. It was for her sake I lied. What else could I
do?” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you often lie like that? I mean—the house on
the cliff;—the <span class='it'>galet</span> beach; the wire you sent him to
come to you in Normandy;—were they all invented?”
Giles ignored the question of his complicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some were invented and some not.” Alix tried to
steady her thoughts so that she might satisfy Giles as
to this point—so irrelevant a point it seemed to her.
“I do not think I could have invented it all so quickly.
We have the little house at Vaudettes. We often go
there. But of course we were not there then. I do not
think I often lie. Only when it is necessary; like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles’s eyes studied her. “And if you had spoken the
truth last night—the whole truth—as you know it—what
would you have said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what I have said to you, Giles. That he was
with us three times. That all his leaves were with us;—the
last a fortnight before he was killed. Was it not
better that I should lie to her than that she should
know her son had been disloyal to her—as well as to
my mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, while she spoke, had put up his hand to rub
in perplexity through his hair; now it paused. “To
your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it not a great wrong he did her, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” Giles’s voice was short and
sharp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came over her with a wave of old bitterness that
this was an aspect of the question he had too much
ignored. “Does my mother’s dignity not count? It
was as if he had something to hide in their friendship;
as if he were ashamed. That was to do her a great
wrong. He owed Maman so much. She had been home
to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memory of all that he owed Maman, the lonely
young soldier; fireside talks; happy walks; plays, pictures,
people; the lavishing of all she had to give;—the
best, was it not, that life had to show?—struck
too deeply at her, and suddenly she felt her eyes fill
with tears. For Giles, too, made part of the wrong to
Maman. His silence had had its complicity. It was as
if he, too, tacitly, had helped Captain Owen to hide
something of which he, too, was ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, I know,” Giles muttered. He saw her
tears and he was dreadfully troubled. “Of course she
was most awfully good to him.—I mean—I can’t
imagine why he said nothing—I can’t imagine why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But wasn’t he lying now? He who had not spoken
to his brother and to Maman in the Bois? The sharp
tangle of her thoughts hurt her. She leaned her elbows
on the table and her forehead on her hands. “I don’t
understand,” she said, keeping herself from crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little kid! Poor little kid!” broke as if irresistibly
from Giles. He was almost crying, too. He walked
up and down behind her. She felt that he would have
liked to kiss and comfort her as if she had been Ruth
or Rosemary. But, turning away at last, he dropped
into his chair before the fire and for a long time they
were both silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Alix,” he said suddenly at last. He had,
it was evident, been thinking things out to quite new
conclusions. “I wasn’t quite straight with you just
now, and I want to be straight with you. I want you
to be straight with me. Will you promise me to? Will
you promise not to lie to me, ever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever? How can I tell?” said Alix from between
her hands. “It is sometimes necessary; if someone
one loves is concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Giles reflected on her proviso and, apparently,
accepted it, “I can know you’ll <span class='it'>want</span> to tell me
the truth, can’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Oh, yes, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. I believe you’ll come to see it’s always better.
Even in a hateful puzzle like this, perhaps. Well,
then, I’ll begin. I wasn’t straight just now. I <span class='it'>can</span>
imagine why Owen didn’t tell us about those Paris
leaves. And I think it best you should be able to imagine
it, too. It was because of Toppie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie?” Alix echoed faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles’s back was turned to her as he sat before the
fire. She could not see his face as he went on: “Yes,
Toppie. They were engaged. They loved each other.
You’ve seen what Toppie feels about him now. He is
her past and he is her present; and her future, too.
There’s nobody in the world for her but him. Well.
That’s it. Can you imagine Toppie, while he was away
in France, seeing as much of another man as Owen saw
of your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix sat staring at the back of Giles’s head. “She
was not alone; in a strange country. Why should he
not find a little peace and happiness with a friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. That seems all right. But why didn’t
he come home and see Toppie? He could have managed
to get one leave for England, instead of three for Paris;
almost certainly, if he’d wanted to. And put all that
aside. The worst thing of all, the thing that would
shatter Toppie’s life if she could know it, is that he
kept quiet about the last two leaves, and never wrote
to any of us that he’d been with you and your mother
for the first. What would Toppie feel if she could
know that? I ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” said Alix, pressing her forehead on her
hands and staring, now, down at the table, “that he
cared most for Maman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it look like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to think. “He would have come back to
Toppie after the war. It was perhaps because of the
war. He did not know, those times he came to us, that
it was the end.” The new, strange shapes of things
Giles had set before her were mingling irrefutably
with all her memories, and the memory of last night
returned to her. Captain Owen and Maman on either
side of the fire. Captain Owen’s dwelling eyes. How
much he had cared for Maman! Oh, how much! And,
trying to answer her own thoughts, she went on:
“Maman did not care most for him. I do not think so.
She cared very much. His death was a great blow.
But so many people care for Maman. He could have
come back to Toppie; Maman would not have kept
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had said this, it was as if the silence between
her and Giles was altered in its quality. He
said nothing for so long a time that the echoes of her
own words began to sing in her head like brazen bells.
They were true words. Yet they did not ring true.
Long before Giles spoke, she wished she had not said
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think,” he said, “that Toppie would have
cared to marry a man who hadn’t been kept from marrying
her?” How dreadful was Giles’s voice. Dark
and heavy, as his eyes had been last night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; no, Giles. I do not mean that. I am sorry.
Not that. It was of Maman I was thinking. You
think of Toppie and I think of Maman; the ones we
love most. No; I see that she would not have married
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>do</span> see, Alix. That’s all I wanted. You see
why he didn’t tell us. And that’s all we need say about
it. He was my brother, and I was awfully fond of him.
But he was very wrong. He did a great wrong. And
you have lied for our sakes, and we’ve profited by it;
if it is profit. All I pray is that you’ll never feel you
have to lie, for anyone’s sake, again. There. That’s
over. We’ll get to work. Have you everything you
want?” Giles got up and took his pipe from the mantelpiece
and his tobacco-pouch from his pocket. “And
don’t let me ever see you afraid to come in here in the
morning. It made me feel quite queer to find you
crouched away in the cold as if I’d been an ogre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were angry with me, Giles; and I
thought I was angry with you. It makes me angry,
always, at once, if I think people are displeased with
me unfairly. I am like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly well it may have made you angry. Of course
I was fairly sick about your lying; and the house on the
cliff; and the wire to Owen; on the top of everything
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even the house might have been a lie, you
know,” said Alix, looking up at him. “If it had needed
to be invented, and if I could have invented it in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it could. Yes; that’s what I thought.
And it made me feel sick. But you’ve promised me
about lies, haven’t you; and you must promise me, besides,
that if you’re ever angry you’ll come and tell me
so. To work, then,” said Giles, and he dropped into
his chair and took up Bergson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix did not take up her pen. She sat above her
paper, but she knew that the last thing she could think
of doing that morning was to write to Maman. She
might be able to read the book about birds, by Hudson,
that Giles had given her, and she drew it towards
her and opened it; but soon found she could not read.
Her heart seemed to be trembling and her blood trembling.
All her mind was shaken; and the picture that
flashed, disappeared, and flashed again, was always
that memory of Captain Owen’s eyes as he gazed
across at Maman from his place before the fire. It was
not Maman’s fault. How could she have averted, how
could she have avoided such a devotion? A sense of
intolerable grief broke down her silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” He put down his book at once. He,
too, was not really reading. Perhaps his heart was
trembling, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I say one thing more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Maman, Giles. It is what you think of her.
Perhaps I am always angry with you, because of what
you think of her. Let me say it now, then. He cared
for her most. But if you knew her you would understand;
you would not blame her; perhaps you would
not blame him so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had turned in his chair and was looking at her
over his shoulder, in deep astonishment. “I’ve never
said a word against your mother, Alix,” he said in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is worse than words, Giles. I am not so stupid.
You put her out. You will not look at her. But if you
could see her you would understand. Maman never
asks for anything. Why should she? She only gives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen her, you know,” said Giles. In sudden,
intense uneasiness, distress, even, he got up and walked
away to the window and stood there, his back to her,
looking out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did that explain nothing?” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is very beautiful,” said Giles. “I never saw
anyone so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, more, much more than that. How could he
help caring for her? How can one govern one’s love for
people? I do not mean that he was right. But he had
always known Toppie, had he not? While Maman was
something quite strange to him. And one thinks most,
perhaps, of what is strange. Oh, I do not forget Toppie.
But it would not have been to keep him true to
Toppie, if she had sent him away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is very beautiful,” Giles repeated, almost
dully; as if that were all he could find to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Giles, if you could only know her!” said Alix.
It was possible to speak like this to him now. And his
back was turned to her and that made it easier. She
leaned her forehead on her hands and looked down at
the table while she went on: “Let me tell you what
Maman makes me think of always. A mountain torrent.
We have them in the mountains near Montarel.
So swift, and dark, and clear, with such deep pools
among the rocks; and such great leaps. Oh, more than
beautiful! I saw an eagle once when I was kneeling by
a pool. As I looked down into the water, it was as if I
looked down into the sky and there was an eagle,
wheeling in the blue—far, far below me. It gave me
the strangest feeling; like Maman sometimes. And her
lovely, small things; like the little pinks and campanulas
that grow along the banks; so sweet and tiny; and
little <span class='it'>mésanges</span> with bright blue heads, hanging upside
down in the birches. There is no one like her. Everyone
else is still and dull beside her. Who could help
loving her? Toppie would love her, I am sure. You
would love her, too, Giles, if you knew her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had turned, while she spoke, and was looking at
her and, lifting her head, she met his eyes and saw how
deeply she had touched him. Deeply touched, deeply
troubled, Giles looked across at her; but she saw that
he was thinking of her and not of Maman. It was as if
he were so sorry for her, and so fond of her, that he
hardly knew what to say. And what he did say at last
was: “You are rather like a mountain torrent yourself;
eagles and campanulas and all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Oh, no.” She was glad that Giles should think
that of her, but it was of Maman she wanted him to
think. “I am one of the still ones; one of the dull ones,
beside Maman. And I never have great shattering
leaps.” She looked away from Giles as she saw further
into her simile, saw things she wanted him—oh! so
wanted him—to see and understand. “Let me tell
you, Giles. When one loves her, that is what one fears
for her—those great leaps down from the rocks. So
splendid; so bright and splendid; but so dangerous.
There is danger for her always. When one loves her,
that is what one fears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said nothing. He stood there, leaning back
against the window. Never in her life had she so spoken
to anybody. For no one but this young Englishman,
so lately a stranger, could she have found such
words. They rose up from her heart unbidden, and the
impulse beneath them was the deepest impulse of her
life. More than the child’s love for its mother. There
was in it a maternal love, watchful and succouring, for
a creature cherished and in peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not looked back at Giles, and he came presently
to her table and stood above her, moving the
objects upon it here and there, as if he could not find
the words to use. And at last he said: “You are right
to love your mother. Never think I don’t understand
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we both love in the same way, Giles,”
said Alix, still not looking at him. “You think of Toppie—and
I think of Maman—perhaps in the same
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood very still. Then he said gently: “Perhaps
we do. I feel Toppie in danger; in dreadful danger
of being hurt; if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is what I mean. And I can help you with
Toppie. I can help you to keep the things that would
hurt her from her. And perhaps, some day, if the time
came, you would help me with Maman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had ceased to move the inkstand and candle-sticks.
He put his hands in his pockets. “What do you
think of as her danger, Alix?” he brought out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had to think; it was not a new wonder; but she
seemed to feel it newly, now that Giles was there to
help her with it. “Perhaps you see it, Giles,” she suggested.
“Is it something in her nature? Is it because
she left my father? Perhaps you see the danger I can
only fear. You give me that feeling sometimes. I am
so much younger than you. There are things I do not
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I see. Yes.” Giles stood there. “You trust
me with it all, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you with everything, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You help me, and I’ll help you if ever I get the
chance. I’ll not forget, Alix.” He put out his hand as
he said these words and Alix felt that their clasp was on
a pact. Yet, as he turned from her and went back to
his chair, she had still the feeling that it was of her, not
of Maman, that he was thinking. It was as if he saw
<span class='it'>her</span> in danger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident to Alix, thinking and thinking of it in
the day and night that followed her talk with Giles,
that the best way of helping him was not to be there at
all. The greater the distance between her and Maman’s
life and Toppie’s life, the safer would Toppie be. She
should never, oh, never, have come at all, and Maman
would never have let her could she have known that
Captain Owen had kept that inculpating silence. But
she could not tell Maman of that now. If Toppie must
not be hurt, neither must Maman. It would hurt her,
terribly, even if she, like Giles, saw at once the reason
for it. But she wrote to Maman the next morning, sitting
there behind Giles, and begged that she might
come home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been long enough in England, she said. It
was not that she was unhappy; they were all too kind
for that. But it was not her life. She was a sea-fish—Alix
found the simile, feeling that it would be helpful
with Maman—and they were river-fishes, and she
was not comfortable in their water. <span class='it'>Je vous supplie,
Maman chérie, laissez-moi revenir.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Eight days passed before Maman’s answer arrived.
It was decisive. She could not think of having Alix
back till Spring. It was everything to her to know that
her darling was benefiting by all the advantages of
Heathside. Even had there not been the wretched
question of money, she would have chosen to have her
there and Alix must not fret; how far less trying it was
for her to be at Heathside with such good friends than
if, like so many <span class='it'>jeunes filles de son âge</span>, she had been in
a convent. As for herself, she was starting in a few days
with friends for a little trip to Italy and would not be
back in Paris till April or May. Maman was evidently
preoccupied, yet determined. There was nothing for it
but to submit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after this, Alix and Giles and Mrs. Bradley
motored to Oxford. She did not enjoy the drive.
It was sad to be losing Giles. She did not know how
she would find Heathside without him. The cold, grey
day matched her mood, and as they entered the mean,
modern streets of Oxford, at dusk, she thought that
she had never seen so <span class='it'>triste</span> a town and wondered that
it could harbour beauty and antiquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles’s rooms, however, were amusing. They belonged
to another world. One went through old courtyards
where the stone was peeling in great flakes from
the walls, up narrow stone staircases, winding and
winding, with names on the doors one passed, and
found oneself at last, high up, overlooking a quadrangle
of green, in a solid, pleasant room which might
have been waiting for Giles during the years of his absence,
so expressive of his personality were the blazing
fire, the deep chairs, even the blue-and-white tea-cups
that waited on the central table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The books and pictures were to go up next day; but
even so the room was cheerful, and a wise, middle-aged
man, whom Alix at first, in some bewilderment, took to
be a professor lending himself to friendly offices, perhaps
in some English ritual of self-effacement, brought
in an excellent tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s what we call a scout,” Giles, smiling, explained
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a Boy Scout!” Alix exclaimed. It was very
confusing, and Giles had to explain it further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Mrs. Bradley slept that night at lodgings in
the town and Alix made her first acquaintance with the
English lodging-house bed. There was no <span class='it'>sommier</span> and
the mattress seemed to be filled with potatoes. One
wound oneself among the lumps and contrived at last
to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They helped Giles with his books and pictures next
morning, and in the afternoon he said he must show her
Oxford while his mother shopped. It was raining.
Giles had on a raincoat turned up about his ears, and
so had she. She had never seen so many bicycles, and
from under a dripping umbrella, after one had dodged
them, she found the Gothic quadrangles and deep
emerald gardens, the meditative swans gliding, at
Worcester, on the water, and the mist-washed vistas of
the High, all <span class='it'>triste</span>. She was depressed at the thought
of leaving Giles behind in such a damp, crumbling
place where it was, indeed, natural to think of philosophers
drinking hemlock, and where only in the refuge
of one’s own room with the wise scout to take care of
one, might one find a sense of warmth and cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t very well imagine how jolly all this is on
a fine day,” said Giles: “when the sun comes out, you
know, and the distances are blue, and the stone golden,
and the gardens full of flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sad, too, Alix felt, though he tried to speak
cheerfully and the day was unbecoming to him as to
everything else. He looked a gaunt, uncouth student,
his nose projecting under his cap and his eyes making
Alix think, in their meditative melancholy, of the
swans. He would, of course, be missing Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the women wear velour hats of the same shape,”
she observed as they made their way along the High.
“All turn up behind and down in front. Now I would
turn mine down behind and up in front—with a very
slight curve to the side; the line is better. And for <span class='it'>costumes
tailleurs</span> it is so needful that the skirt should hang
evenly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said Giles with a gloomy grin. “I’m showing
you the architecture, not the clothes of Oxford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they all the wives of philosophers?” Alix inquired,
and the question indubitably interested her
more than the architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good many of them are, no doubt,” laughed
Giles. “Do you wonder if my wife will look like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had a sudden vision of Toppie in the rainy High
Street. Yes, even dear Toppie would sink, she felt,
into the fatal sameness, embody the type. She could
see her, slender, in her wet grey tweed, speeding on a
bicycle in just such a velour hat. They, too, were perhaps
Toppies if one could have a careful look at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to live in Oxford, Giles?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to.—Here is Magdalen and the tower.
Let’s cross the bridge so that you can see the tower.—It’s
where I want to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the bridge and he told her about the
tower and the May morning ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be very charming, very gay,” said Alix.
“And would you care to marry soon?” The question,
she knew, was academic, merely. There could be no
hope of marriage for Giles as long as Toppie thought
only of Captain Owen. But they could both pretend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t marry soon.” Giles was still laughing,
though evidently a little disconcerted by her lack of
appreciation. “I’ve no money.” He led her off to
Christ Church meadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at all, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, only enough to have a very dowdy wife.
To buy her a better hat and a smarter <span class='it'>costume tailleur</span>
I’d need a great deal more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Captain Owen was to marry.” Alix ventured
it. It was all so remote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles felt it so. He elucidated the financial differences
of the family. “We’ve all got a little. He went
into the city, into stock-broking, and was making a
very good thing of it. He could very well afford to
marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you not care for stock-broking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I care for philosophy. Unlucky for my wife,
isn’t it, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know. Perhaps not if she had taste. One
can do so much with very little money if one has taste.
But would they know—the others—if she had to live
in Oxford, that her hats and dresses were different?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I expect women always know that—even
the wives of philosophers!” laughed Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of her æsthetic deficiencies, she felt that she
kept up his spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For tea they went to a professor friend—a real professor
this time—who had known Mrs. Bradley’s
father. Everybody seemed to have known Mrs. Bradley’s
father. He lived in the Banbury Road with two
unmarried daughters, and was old but robust and
bearded and jovial, and he kept a hand on Giles’s
shoulder for a long time and promised Mrs. Bradley
good things of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood and smiled and promised nothing. She
had an impression of his strength and self-knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur le professeur’s daughters were middle-aged
ladies with lean red faces and grey hair strained
tightly back above their ears and clothes of which all
that could be said was that they were warm and clean.
So tall, so spare they were, the pair of them, so rigid
and with such ingenuous eyes, that they made Alix
think of the elongated figures on the western portals of
Chartres; only the Misses Cockburn were not beautiful
in their strangeness and had none of the exquisite
<span class='it'>chinoiserie</span> of aspect upon which Maman and monsieur
Villanelle had discoursed on that summer afternoon
when they had visited the great cathedral. How it all
rushed over her as she sat at the little table Miss Jennifer
had placed for her near the window! She saw
them all three, Maman in white under her white sunshade,
in the hot French sunlight before the sublime
object. Up into the blue it went, august, almost terrifying,
so beautiful that it made one want to cry. And
as they had wandered in and out, into the vast, illuminated
darkness where the rose windows hung like
apparitions, out into the fretted portals with the sunlight
washing up their steps, Maman had told her of a
Queen Alix who had borne a part in its history. Her
heart contracted as she remembered it all. Maman
might have been one of those queens. She so belonged
to Chartres. When Chartres was in one’s blood, what
could one feel for Oxford?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had time for these comparisons. The Misses
Cockburn were kind, but they paid no attention to her
beyond carefully feeding her; as if, she reflected, she
had been a pet dog led in by Mrs. Bradley. People in
England, she had already surmised, did not feel an obligation
to entertain, further than by feeding, other
people’s friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat and ate her scone and drank her tea and
looked out at a laburnum-tree and a hawthorn-tree, all
leafless and dripping on the background of ornamental
red brick opposite. All the houses were of red brick
and all so singularly alike in spite of their adventurous
excrescences. “<span class='it'>Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose</span>,”
thought Alix, as she watched the tea-time lights come
out in the bow-windows with Gothic points over them,
and felt that they held learned, innocent people who
would not be disconcerted by anything that happened
in the universe. She had never seen a place that
seemed to her quite so safe as the Banbury Road. And
yet such safety made part of the <span class='it'>tristesse</span>. Dieu! how
<span class='it'>triste</span> it was! How dreadful it would be to be caught
and imprisoned there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Grace came to draw the curtain and asked Alix
if she were warm and Alix said she was. Giles seemed
quite at home, seemed, indeed, part of it, lifting the
scones from the little brass stand before the fire, talking
about municipal elections to Miss Jennifer and
about the Bach Choir to Miss Grace. With Giles as the
link of identity between them, she saw that Heathside
was part of the Banbury Road, too. Even Giles seemed
far away as the sense of alienation grew within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as she sat there, alone, apart, the throb of a
big motor came up to the gate, and a moment afterwards
a lady was among them who, by her presence,
dispelled the sense of loneliness. It might have been
into Maman’s salon that she came, so vivid was Alix’s
sense of knowing what she would do and say and of
liking both beforehand. All furs and pearls and softness,
and such sweet smiles, she was one of the people
who could see and blow and catch the soap-bubbles,
the beautiful, impalpable things of human intercourse,
and while she talked to monsieur le professeur, she cast
mild, bright glances at Giles, at Mrs. Bradley, at herself.
Alix saw that it was at herself that she looked
most, and presently, when the lady and Mrs. Bradley
talked, Mrs. Bradley called her to them, and holding
her hand, scanning her face, the lady said she knew
her name. “It’s there behind me; where I don’t quite
know;—in an old letter; a volume of <span class='it'>mémoires</span>; an
ancestor of mine, I feel it must have been, who knew a
Mouveray in Paris before the Revolution. Yes, that
was it. It comes back to me. A comte Henri de Mouveray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix remembered, too. “He was guillotined at Lyon.
He was a great-uncle of Grand-père’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where is Grand-père?” asked Lady Mary
Hamble, for such was her name. “Do you live with
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix told her that she had lived with him; but that
he was dead. “I live with my mother in Paris,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Lady Mary was gone, Alix felt herself
scanned by Miss Grace and Miss Jennifer as if from
a spaniel she had altered to a monkey; not more interesting,
but more curious. Monsieur le professeur
still didn’t see her at all. He brushed aside Lady
Mary and went on talking about Relativity to Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; was it not strange?” said Alix, as, in Giles’s
rooms again, Mrs. Bradley commented on the romantic
encounter. “There was his portrait at Montarel,
that Henri de Mouveray. So grave yet so gay a face,
blue-eyed, and with dark hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like you, Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley, and Alix remembered
that he was like her; very.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think that someone so near you was guillotined
at Lyon,” Mrs. Bradley mused. “He could have
known your grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. If he had not been guillotined, if he had lived
long enough, he could have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think Lady Mary very lovely, Giles?”
said Mrs. Bradley. “She must be as old as I am, I suppose;
yet how lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not nearly as lovely as you are,” said Giles,
poking the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley laughed at the absurdity. “That’s
loyal—but not accurate, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s very pretty, and she’s never had a doubt.
She’s always felt that she was lovely and that everyone
thought her lovely, and I suppose that preserves
the complexion,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if everyone thinks one so, is it not likely that
one is lovely?” Alix inquired. “And if one is so, why
should one not think so oneself?” She considered that
Giles was captious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one is as right in every way as she thinks herself,”
said Giles. “No one can be so smooth without
being artificial. She’s awfully nice, I’m sure; but for
beauty, give me Mummy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not be polite to contradict him, but Alix,
too, thought Giles absurd.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>She and Mrs. Bradley motored home together next
day. It had stopped raining and the air had the unexpected
softness that mid-winter in England can mitigatingly
display. Alix had never yet seen so much of
Mrs. Bradley as on this drive. She was the most occupied
person; she was always immersed in occupations;
and to have her beside one, with nothing to occupy
her except driving the car, was to see her with a
new completeness. Mrs. Bradley was only not intimate
because absorbed in affairs remote from her own interests.
She was not even intimate with her own children,
for Alix could not remember ever having heard her
talk with them about herself. She tenderly took them
for granted and took for granted—too much, Alix
considered—their capacity for directing their own
lives once the main lines were laid out for them. But
to-day, with its sense of interlude, no papers to read,
no committees to attend, it was as if without becoming
intimate she became confiding. It touched Alix to
hear her. It touched her because she felt that Mrs.
Bradley must so often need to confide and would not
know it. She talked to her about Giles. “I know he’ll
do well. I know he will be useful. Giles will always
pull his weight wherever he is,” she said, and the conception
of life as a boat where one’s meaning consisted
in pulling one’s weight was a very new one to Alix.
When his mother so spoke, she saw Giles sitting, half
stripped, in the chilly English air, grey water beneath,
grey sky above, bent to the oars among comrades and
ready for the word of command. That was what his
mother desired for him; that strenuous, rigorous life.
Maman did not think of life like that. She wanted no
rigours for her child. She didn’t care a bit about her
being useful. Other people were to be of use to her and
she was to enjoy herself. That was Maman’s idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve seen, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Bradley, her
gentle eyes fixed before her as she drove, “how fond
he is of Toppie. It’s always been so. He’s never
thought of anybody else. Even before she and Owen
fell in love with each other. I’ve sometimes wondered—I’ve
sometimes wished—” Mrs. Bradley’s voice
dropped to a musing uncertainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles was much younger than Captain Owen, was
he not?” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much younger. He is a year older than Toppie.
Twenty-five. But it wasn’t that. She would, I’m
afraid, never have thought of him, with Owen there.
Perhaps she had always been too sure of him and taken
him too much for granted, while with Owen, until he
did, at last, fall in love with her, she was never sure.
He was fond of several people, you see, before he was
fond of Toppie. I’m afraid she suffered, poor darling.
And that’s what one feels,” Mrs. Bradley mused on,
while Alix knew a growing discomfort in hearing her.
“Owen could have been happy with so many girls; it
wasn’t, with him, the one great thing only; whereas
with Giles it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And perhaps if she had married him,” said Alix,
her thoughts held by that sense of something painful,
twisted, difficult to see plainly, “she would have suffered
even more. If he continued to be fond of other
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but that couldn’t have been after they were
married!” Mrs. Bradley exclaimed, and with a shock
of surprise in her voice, while her eyes, almost scared
by the suggestion, turned to scan the meditative face
of the little French girl beside her. “That couldn’t
have been after he loved her at last; after they were
engaged. Oh, no; Owen would have been faithful, always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all men are not faithful, are they?” Alix commented,
keeping her eyes before her and her voice
quiet and impersonal. She felt that she would like to
know what Mrs. Bradley thought on this subject. Had
not Giles’s horror been somewhat misplaced? “So
many wives, I mean, from what one hears, have unfaithful
husbands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley continued to scan her and with even
more alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I hope you don’t hear of such dreadful things,
dear child. No good husband is unfaithful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it so very dreadful? Can one govern one’s heart?
I see that it is different for a wife,” said Alix. “She is
at home and has the children. But a man—out in the
world—May he not form many attachments without
so much blame?—I do not understand these things,
but I cannot see why it is so dreadful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too young, dear, to understand them. Yet
even you, I am sure, can imagine how terrible it would
be to know that your husband, whom you loved and
trusted, loved other people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be very sad.” Alix considered the remote
contingency. “I see that it might make me sad—if I
loved him very much. But I should have the children,
the <span class='it'>foyer</span>. And then he might still love me most, while
loving others, too. Do you not find that possible, here
in England? In France, I am sure, we do not feel it so
strange a thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We feel it strange; very strange and dreadful,”
said Mrs. Bradley with as much vehemence as she ever
displayed on any subject. “And you will, too, I am
sure, darling, when you are older and understand what
it means to trust someone with your life.—No, no;
such a thing would have been impossible with Owen
and Toppie. All that I meant was that his love was
different in quality from Giles’s. Giles’s nature, in
some ways, is deeper than dear Owen’s was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Deeper. One feels that at once,” Alix murmured,
while the thought, seen at last clearly, pierced
her through that Giles was held from his happiness by
an illusion since Toppie might not have cared for Captain
Owen had she known how much he cared for
Maman. “Perhaps in time she will come to see what
Giles is and love him. Do you not think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what I hope for more than anything, Alix,”
said Mrs. Bradley. “Giles has had such a sad life. You
wouldn’t think it, perhaps. He doesn’t show it, unless
one knows him very well. Even as a little boy I always
felt him rather frustrated and sad. He adored
Owen, who didn’t pay much attention to him; and
he adored Toppie who never gave him a hope. And
then the war came and ended his youth and he saw
worse things than Owen saw. He saw the worst
things. His best friends were killed beside him. He
went through everything. They all had to face the
problem of it, the boys like Giles. It was never such
a problem to men like Owen. They accepted it and
didn’t try to understand. Giles hasn’t been embittered,
as some of our young men have; but there is
such a weight of grief on his heart. I feel it always. I
so long for some happiness to come to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all true. Alix had seen it in Giles’s face. Under
his vehemence, his gaiety, he carried dark memories in
his heart; and there were darknesses his mother did not
know of. Perhaps it helped him to be less lonely that
she should know of them and that they should be her
darknesses, too. It gave Alix courage to bear the
weight of perplexity and fear, during the winter, to feel
that she shared the weight with Giles. She missed him
so much at Heathside; yet he was there, too, in her
sense that she was helping him with Toppie, that she,
too, was shielding Toppie from hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote to her, and though he did not ask her for
news of Toppie, she knew that was what he wanted
and gave him every detail when she answered. Toppie
went away to Bath at the end of February, but until
then Alix sent Giles her bulletins. She and Toppie
often walked together; they read together, too; and
she often made Toppie laugh with her stories about
the people at Montarel, the funny things they did and
said. Giles was told of all this, and about the Greater
Spotted Woodpecker that she and Toppie saw in the
birch-woods, tapping with stealthy fierceness at a tree-trunk,
beautiful in his Chinese white and black and
vermilion; and about Jock who always came with them
on their walks and had really adopted her as his most
authentic mistress. She had not much to say about
the High School and Ruth and Rosemary. But then it
was Toppie Giles wanted to hear of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spring came at last, the early flowers, the returning
birds, Toppie back from Bath and the Easter holidays
hovering on a near horizon. And one day at tea-time
Mrs. Bradley handed her a letter she had just received
from Lady Mary Hamble, a letter in its unexpectedness
and sweetness that was like the Spring. Could
Mrs. Bradley lend Alix to them for a week-end, Lady
Mary asked. There were to be young people in the
house and a little dance and they would all enjoy
having her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, in her pleasure, strangely compounded of a
sense of relief, escape, and the soft breath of a familiar
balm wafted towards her, Alix did not notice the dates.
Then, after Mrs. Bradley had said, “How delightful;
of course you must go, dear,” she saw that the Monday
of Lady Mary’s dance was the Monday of Mrs. Bradley’s;
the dance to which Toppie had promised to come;
the dance for which Giles would be back; the dance to
show her white taffeta dress; <span class='it'>her</span> dance; the invitations
all out and all accepted. “But our dance is on that
Monday,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be helped,” said Mrs. Bradley. “We’ll
have to give another smaller one some day later on. I
don’t think you ought to miss the much prettier dance
at Lady Mary’s. You have us always, you see, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles doesn’t really count at a dance,” smiled Mrs.
Bradley. “And he will be at home all the holidays.
You won’t be missing Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was with them, and she smiled, too, looking
at Alix and said: “You’re right not to go. Giles will be
coming home that very Saturday. You couldn’t miss
his coming home even if you did miss the dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she really mustn’t miss the week-end at Cresswell
Abbey,” said Mrs. Bradley. “It’s such a lovely
place, I’ve always heard. And she’ll be back on Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll ask her another time,” said Toppie. “People
would ask Alix another time,” and she smiled on at
her young friend, well pleased with her, Alix saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they’ll ask her, Mummy!” cried Ruth
who, with Rosemary, had sat transfixed with indignation
while the invitation was thus discussed. “And it
makes no difference if they don’t. Who are the Hambles,
anyway! What does Alix care about them? She
doesn’t know them and doesn’t want to. I’ve seen
your Lady Mary’s picture in the ‘Daily Mirror’—drooping
around with bare shoulders and a plume and
pretending not to know she’s being snapped. I hate
such empty-headed creatures, and Alix would be bored
stiff by them. Of course she can’t go! Of course she
must be here for our dance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was quite sure that she would not be bored by
Lady Mary; but she was also sure that she could not
go. No one at Heathside would appreciate the white
taffeta as Lady Mary would. There would be no one
at the Heathside dance she would like as much, she
felt sure of it, as those young people at Cresswell Abbey—no
one, that is, except Giles; and he, as his
mother had said, truly she felt sure, did not count at
dances; but all the same she could not go, and Ruth
and Rosemary might think, if they pleased, that it was
for their reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not tell Giles in her next letter about the
visit to Cresswell Abbey; but when he came home,
Ruth told him, the first thing, at tea-time, all assembled
as they were in the drawing-room, Toppie and
herself in their accustomed places on the sofa beside
Mrs. Bradley, and Ruth sitting on the arm of her
brother’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only think of it, Giles! Mummy actually thought
she ought to go, because Cresswell Abbey is such a
lovely place! The day of our dance, mind you! Toppie’s
cousins here and all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles seemed taken aback. “The week-end? She’d
have been going to-day,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And missed your coming home, Giles! As if she
<span class='it'>could</span>!” cried Rosemary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Amy expecting her puppies any day now,”
said Jack. “I thought they’d have come this morning.
She’d want to see them as soon as they were born,
wouldn’t you, Alix?—only we must be very careful
not to look at them too often. Amy’s awfully nervous
when she has her pups.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mummy,” said Giles, eyeing his contented sisters,
“you ought to have made her go. Alix is over here to
see England, all she can of it. And she really doesn’t
see so very much of it with us, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did my best, dear,” said Mrs. Bradley, pouring
out her tea. “She quite refused. And Toppie aided
and abetted her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I aided and abetted her, Giles,” said Toppie,
and she smiled now at him with more sweetness than
Alix had ever yet seen on her face for Giles. “She can
go another time to Lady Mary’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, one never knows about that,” Giles murmured.
But now he was thinking more about Toppie’s smile
than about Alix’s frustrated visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you want to go to Cresswell Abbey?” he
asked Alix next morning in the study, and with the
question the time of their separation collapsed and, his
eyes on hers, she felt him near and familiar once more,
concerned, as always, for her welfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was it. He understood that it might have given
her so much pleasure and Ruth and Rosemary didn’t
understand that at all. And he wanted her to have
gone because he wanted her to have pleasure. He was
like Maman in that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She confessed. “Yes, I did. But not so much that I
could miss you and our dance. The dance was planned
for me, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles rubbed his hand through his hair.—His
mother should have corrected him of that trick, though
Alix rather liked to see him do it; it left his hair very
much on end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s decent of you; awfully decent of you. But you
wanted to go, of course, you dear little kid. And I’d
like to think you were to get a wider look at England
than you get with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she will ask me again, Giles. Your mother
wrote and explained it to her and she wrote back and
said it must be for another time. I think she likes
me,” said Alix. “And I like her, too. Though Ruth
and Rosemary find her empty-headed. Perhaps it is
empty-headed people that I do like,” Alix smiled.
“Perhaps I am empty-headed myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you took to each other. I saw you belonged
with each other,” Giles mused. “I’m awfully sorry
you didn’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you rather I were staying with her than
here with you, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I’d rather you were staying here. But I’d like
you to have a slice of cake now and then after all the
thick bread-and-butter. Now you, of course, would
like to have the cake all the time,” and Giles smiled at
her, summoning her to confess to her frivolity. But
when he asked her like that, there in the study, with
the gas-fire and the untidy heaped books and the Greek
temples and the foolish animals on the mantelpiece,
Alix did not feel so sure. She liked Lady Mary. She
loved the balm she wafted. She felt sure that no one
here would appreciate her white taffeta; they would
think Ruth’s pink silk ninon with the embroidered
edges just as pretty. But there would not, she felt
even surer, be any one at Cresswell Abbey who would
understand as Giles did.</p>

<div><h1>PART II</h1></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est la France</span>,” said Alix. She leaned beside him on
the railing of the Channel steamer and looked through
the blue of the July day to where the town thinly
shaped itself, like a line of grey-white shells floating
between sea and sky. Her phrase was spoken in a tone
of quiet statement, unstressed by any emotion, yet
Giles, while they watched the shore together, felt its
echoes stretching back revealingly into the past and
out towards the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was really what had been at the bottom of her
heart during all her time with them; France. And if
she had talked about it so little that must merely have
been, he reflected, because she cared about it so much.
Of course she loved her own country; he could not expect
or wish anything else; but had she, he wondered,
any more love for England now than when she had
first come among them? And he felt, when he asked
himself the question, a little rueful and a little vexed.
She was not a shallow child; that he knew; it was because
she was not shallow that he minded her imperviousness
to all that meant so much to them.
With the imperviousness went an oddly mature security,
as of a creature formed and fixed and not to be
altered by circumstance; and it was when he thought
of this security that Giles felt a little angry; for, after
all, what had France given her, poor kid?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles did not think of his family, in particular, as
benefactors to the little French girl. That side of her
indebtedness was not one to engage his attention. It
was England as a whole that he had hoped would by
this time have crept about her heart; England with its
gentle days of Spring, its balmy days of Summer; all
the happy family life they had just come from; tennis,
dogs, strawberries on the lawn, and long bicycle rides
over the hills; England’s sweetness and fidelity embodied
in his mother; its holiness in Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The starlike image of Toppie rose before the young
man’s mind and with it his deepest doubt of the little
French girl beside him. He had come from pity for the
child’s unconscious plight, pity for the cruelty of her
position there among them—a little creature so proud
that it would have been to her a burning humiliation
could she have guessed how her mother had dealt with
her and them in foisting her upon them—he had come,
from this initial pity, to feel affection, then an odd, perplexed
respect, and finally a profound, a tender solicitude.
It was upon her future in France, with her
mother, that it centred; but that was the outward aspect
of the inner fear; for when he thought of Toppie
and of holiness the question he had also to ask himself
was whether Alix was impervious to holiness, too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles felt that he would be better able to face that
question, and with it the whole problem of the child’s
future, when he had seen “Maman.” That was why he
was here. That was why he had said “yes,” on the
morning, a fortnight ago, when Maman’s letter at last
had come summoning Alix home. Since their interview,
long ago in the Winter, he and Alix had never
spoken of their mutual secret, that dreadful one-sided
secret that Giles visualized as an unexploded bomb lying
there between them and liable at a touch to go off
and scatter the family happiness to fragments. The
interview had ended in a pact. She was to help him;
she had, poor little creature, helped him; he still felt
stung with shame to think how much; to think how he
had profited, how they all had profited, by her falsehoods.
And he was bound to help her. He knew, when
Maman’s letter came, all that lay behind the appeal as
she said: “Oh, Giles, could you not come with me?
and stay if only for a little while; so that at last you
and Maman may meet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt that it would help if he were to know Maman.
And it might well be that he could only effectually
help Alix if he faced at last the baleful woman who
had brought the hidden disaster to their lives. It was
better that he should know, in regard to Alix’s future,
what they were “up against.” It had not been of
Maman he was thinking when he assented; it had been,
as on that day last Winter, of Alix herself. And that
was why he was here, on his way to Normandy and the
village on the cliff, and it was Dieppe that was showing
now, along its wharves, façades of sunlit houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think, Giles,” said Alix, “that the air in
France is very different? Like golden wine?—There
was a wine made at a little mountain village near
Montarel—Vernay-les-Vouvières it is called—and
the wine after it. I wish you could see that village. So
high and steep it is, the road climbs for miles before you
reach it; and higher still, above the village, is an old,
old statue of <span class='it'>la Sainte Vierge</span>, looking down over the
vineyards and blessing them. When one stands beside
her one sees over all the crests of the mountain-ranges;
like blue rolling waves. We used to drink Vernay-les-Vouvières
at Grand-père’s. It was very cheap, for it
could not travel; it lost its bouquet at once if it travelled.
And it was a delicious wine; so pale, so light,
so delicate. One felt like singing when one drank it.
I think the air of France makes one feel like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley’s household, though not pledged to
teetotal principles, eschewed all alcoholic drink, and
Giles, as he listened, seeing the Virgin, the vineyards,
the ingenuous piety, the pagan gaiety that Alix’s
words conjured up, wondered what her impressions of
their unenlivened meals must have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could see Vernay-les-Vouvières,” he said.
“A beautiful country yours must be, so near the Alps.—We
have sunny days in England, you know. It’s a
French superstition to think that English people go
staggering about in a fog all the year round. You
ought to have got over that,” he added. “Our weather
is as good as the weather in Northern France; every
bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But different, Giles. As good; but not so happy.
Never like wine, I think. Always there is something
soft and sleepy in the air. After the air of France it is
like milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milk is a very excellent thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Excellent. As a food. But it does not make
one want to sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Giles said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a French town Dieppe is not so specially beautiful,”
Alix took up presently; for she and Giles knew
each other so well that a disagreement could be allowed
to fall between them disregarded. “I do not think that
for a French town it has special beauty; yet, seen
like this, with the harbours, and the wharves, and
houses—all so golden, do you not think it is very
lovely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had just been thinking so. “Yes. Quite lovely,”
he admitted. “For a French town it’s rather rambling
and shambling, too, and I like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but it keeps its dignity all the same,” said Alix.
“It has gone where it meant to go and when it got there
it stood up well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have dignified towns,” said Giles. “Edinburgh;
you must see Edinburgh one day, Alix; and Bath; and
Ludlow. Of course, as to ramble, London is a bad
offender; but London is beautiful all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful, do you think, Giles? Beautiful you
mean, then, as one might find the face of a dear, funny
old great-grandmother beautiful, for what it means;
but not for what it looks; I think it a very ugly town,”
said Alix in her tone of happy statement—for Alix
was very happy to-day. “It is like an old great-grand-mother
over a tea-pot; and Paris is like a goddess
with a wreath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like old great-grandmothers much better than
goddesses,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same he understood. She was initiating these
comparisons—and it was so uncharacteristic of her to
make comparisons—not from any desire to disparage,
but from the deep, joyous excitement, the love and
pride that could not be repressed and that she could
not overtly have expressed without expressing emotion
as well. She thrilled with it, he knew, leaning beside
him, her profile, forcible, intent, golden against
the sea. It looked golden like that because the sun fell
on it and the sea was blue; but he had always thought
Alix’s skin a queer colour and never knew whether he
liked or disliked it. Sometimes it was grey, like pussy-willows:
and sometimes it was green, making one think
of olive-trees or the patina on an old bronze; and sometimes,
as to-day, it was pure gold; and always it seemed
to be the final expression of significant structure rather
than a decorative bloom, and to go with her blue eyes
and black hair whichever tint it took. But, as he told
himself, he was a sentimental Englishman and liked
girls to be the colour of apple-blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had fallen to silence now, and he was keeping
his mind rather consciously on their friendly altercation,
and even on Alix’s profile, because he did not wish
to reflect on what lay before him. He had not an idea
of what he was to say to Alix’s mother, or to do with
her; and it was no good thinking about it until he saw
her; saw her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saw her again! How the phrase brought back the
unforgettable pang and misery. How the unforgettable
image floated in his memory, vivid yet unseizable; irrelevant
as it were and not to be woven to any secure
conclusion. It had been the stillest day, that Spring
day in the Bois. The purpling grey of branches, above,
behind the wandering pair, had melted to shroud-like
distances and they had emerged before his astonished
eyes like the spectral creatures of a clairvoyant vision;
silent, and with linked arms. He had gazed at them,
and as he gazed his impulse to go forward and greet his
brother was checked ere it was formed. Owen here in
Paris: Owen with madame Vervier—he had known
at once that it was she; Owen to look like that. Rooted
among the thinly scattered saplings of the wood he had
remained, gazing until they passed away and the white
distance received them into its folds as it had given
them up—ominous disappearance of the brother he
was never to see again. Rooted he stood, and heard
the wild, monotonous phrase of a missel-thrush ring
forth suddenly from overhead and felt his mind slowly
take possession of the icy grief that crept upon it.
Owen’s face had given him all the truth; its rapture;
its terrible stilled restlessness. And though she was
so quiet, walking there, her head bent down a little, her
eyes fixed before her, Giles had felt, for all the innocence
of his chaste boyhood, that she was so quiet because
she possessed him so completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How clearly he could see her still, with her brooding
brightness, her soft gloom. He could not see her as
baleful; he could not see her as guilty; he only saw her
walking there secure in power and loveliness. And this
was the irrelevance, the tormenting discrepancy; for
she was the woman who had taken Owen from Toppie;
she was the woman who, after her lover’s death, had
placidly made use of what assets he had left her; his
family; and its trust in him and her. And she was the
more baleful to him from the fact that, though he remembered
her so vividly and knew such portentous
things about her, herself he did not know at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one thing about her, however, that he
could and ought to know at once, and the thought of it
worked its way up into his mind while he and Alix
leaned there. They had never again spoken of their secret,
but, before he met her mother he ought to know
whether Alix had told her what he knew of Owen’s
stays with them in Paris. Before he saw madame Vervier
he ought to know what she knew about him; and
suddenly, his eyes fixed upon the wharves and houses
of Dieppe, he said: “You think she’ll feel it all right
that I’m come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wrote to her that you were coming,” said Alix.
Her mind had perhaps been following some train of
thought not far removed from his, for she spoke as if
they were continuing a theme rather than taking it up.
“She will be delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she? Look here, Alix”—Giles gazed down
over the railing at the sea—“she couldn’t be delighted,
I take it, if she knew that I had a grievance
about my brother on her account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had spoken very abruptly, yet he had, he felt,
put it well. In the little pause that followed his words,
he was pleased with himself for having found any so
colourless and unprovocative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What we know of your brother,” said Alix after her
pause, “would not give her a grievance against you;
only against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Against him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he not deceive her, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deceive her? Oh, I see. You think he didn’t tell
her that he’d kept us in the dark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could not have told her, Giles; if that is really
what you are asking me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, a little confused, retraced his steps. “What
I’m really asking you is whether <span class='it'>you’ve</span> told her. I want
to know where I stand with her. Haven’t you felt that
she ought to be told?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Alix was silent, and for a longer time. Then
she said: “It has been my great perplexity. She does
not know. Of course she does not know. But I wrote
to her at once, that time last Winter, and begged that
I might come home; and when I found she could not
have me, I thought it best to say nothing then. Perhaps
I was wrong. Perhaps you will blame me, Giles.
But I thought it best to wait. It will give her such pain
when she knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would never have given her so much pain Giles,
with a sudden glow of indignation, felt, as it had already
given her daughter. What Alix had suffered in
wrestling with her problem was in her voice. “Blame
you? I? You poor kid!” he exclaimed. And he added:
“After all, his silence meant devotion to herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” said Alix. “I am afraid she will
not feel it so. I am afraid she will feel that it meant
cowardice and lack of loyalty;—as it does to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was now aware of an uncomfortable astonishment.
He had to remember that Alix was nearly seventeen.
A woman could not have spoken with a more secure
assurance of putting him in his place; and if, by
the same token, she put Owen in his place, was she not,
from her own point of view, her woman’s dignity veiled
only by her child’s ignorance, justified in doing so? For
if Owen had really kept madame Vervier in the dark
she might have a right to resentment. The two culprits
should have had no secrets from one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” he repeated, lamely, as he felt. “And you
would not like to spoil her memory of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We kept it from your mother and from Toppie
because it would spoil their memory of him,” said
Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; but you’ll own, won’t you, that it would be
a far worse spoiling for them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. For them it would be worse. But why should
anyone feel pain now, when it is all over? Why should
anything be spoiled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only,” said Giles, going carefully, “that it
seems unfair to your mother to let me come and keep
her in ignorance of what I know. It’s for you to judge,
Alix; but since you love your mother so much, I rather
wonder that you can bear to keep such a secret from
her. And, quite apart from me, oughtn’t she to know
just what she does send you back to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send me back to?” Alix echoed, and her eyes met
his strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Before you come back in the Autumn, don’t
you think she ought to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really imagine, Giles, that if Maman knew,
she would send me back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well”—he felt that he flushed. He had not foreseen
this emergency—“since I know, and since I want
you back;—why not she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you count Maman’s pride for nothing, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier’s pride had never for a moment engaged
his attention, and did not now. His attention
was fully engaged by Alix’s pride, facing him with a
look of granite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t really see why she should take it so hardly,”
he said after a moment; but he was horribly uncomfortable,
for he was not speaking with frankness to his
young friend. “Your relation to us has, really, nothing
to do with her relation to Owen. It’s a new thing; and
that’s an old one; and as you say, it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she could not have me there on false pretences,
Giles,” said Alix. The pride had dropped now. It was
as if with sudden sadness she saw too well the reasons
for his misunderstanding. “I could not be there on
false pretences. You have a right to think it of me
since I have never told her. But it is all over now; the
new as well as the old. I need never tell her. For I
am at home again and I shall never go back to Heathside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never come back to Heathside!” Actually for the
moment Maman, Owen, Toppie, all the grief and perplexity
that hung about these figures, were swept from
Giles’s mind by his deep discomfiture. “But this is
only your holiday. Your mother’s letter said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks it is only my holiday. But I am older
now. I shall see to it that I do not return to England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ass that he had been not to realize the <span class='it'>impasse</span> to
which their talk was leading them! Too obviously,
from Alix’s side, this was an inevitable decision. And
Giles saw that from his side it should have been so, too.
With Alix safely back in France, there would be no
more danger of pain for his mother and wreckage for
Toppie; Owen’s memory might sleep in untarnished
peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alix herself had come to count for far too much.
It was as if he saw her walking away into a dark forest
where dreadful creatures prowled. Ever since that day
in his study, she had counted for too much. She was
too fine, too brave, too loyal a little creature to be given
up to her fate. He had felt that day that he would fight
her fate for her, and he felt now that the moment had
come for the first grapple. But the worst of the problem
was that in fighting Alix’s fate he must fight her.
He could not tell her the fact that would have turned
her pride to dust and ashes. He could not tell her that
her mother had sent her to them on pretences so false
that the minor falsity she repudiated paled beside
them. Horribly handicapped as he was for the contest,
he seized his bull by the horns: “Look here, my dear
child,” he declared, speaking with all the elder brother
authority he could summon up, “you said to me that
day when we talked that you were going to trust me.
Well, I ask you to trust me now. I want you back. We
all want you back. Let that suffice. No; wait a moment.
I know what you are going to say;—if Toppie
knew would she want you? I’ll take the responsibility
of answering for Toppie. She is so fond of you that I
know she would. Isn’t that enough, really? Can’t we
leave it at that? And you’re quite right not to tell your
mother. Let the whole thing rest for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were on his while he spoke to her and she
listened to him gently; but her face still kept the invulnerable
look strange in one so young. “You are kind,
dear Giles,” she said. “I do trust you. But you can’t
answer for Toppie. You can’t answer for anybody.
And I have not only myself to think of. I have
Maman. I <span class='it'>can</span> answer for Maman in this matter. She
would not let me come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you so sure of that?” broke from Giles. And
now, pushed to it, he ventured far; he ventured very
far, indeed. “After all she must have known that he
kept a great deal from us. After all she must have
known that he cared more for her than he did for Toppie;
that he had been faithless to Toppie because of
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor little Alix. It was not fair. She paled in hearing
him. And for a long moment she stood silent beside
him, looking down at the sea. “May he not have
kept that from her, too?” was what she found at last
to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that possible?” Giles asked; but he
was sorry now, seeing the deep trouble on her face, that
he had spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would not have been possible,” she said
slowly. “But things may be known and yet remain unspoken,
Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not question her further. He could not ask
madame Vervier’s young daughter if she really believed
that those things had been unspoken between
his brother and her mother. There had been an element
of desecration in going even so far as he had gone.
And he had gained nothing by it, for after the little
pause that fell between them, Alix added, in no spirit
of retaliation as he saw, but as though she put up a
final barrier against his persistence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even if they were not there, Giles; even if all
the difficult things we know of were not there, I should
still not come back to Heathside. I do not care, ever,
to leave France again. I could not, again, leave
Maman.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The train moved slowly, almost ruminatingly, along
the golden landscape, a little local train stopping at
every station. The crops were still uncut and their vast
undulations were broken only by lines of lonely, poplared
road, or marshalled woods venturing out, here
and there, upon the plains. Empty and rather sad, for
all the splendour of the gold beneath, the blue above,
it looked to Giles; but that might have been, he knew,
because of its associations for him with scenes of the
war; and he was feeling a little sick, too, apprehensions
of the approaching future seizing him as he and
Alix sat silent in the second-class carriage, where both
the windows were tightly shut. Alix had widely opened
hers on entering, but at the first station a lady had got
in—little shopping people of the local <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> the
passengers were, more estranged from fashion, Giles
thought, than their equivalent English types—and,
wrapping a scarf at once about her neck, she had complained
of the effect of the <span class='it'>courant d’air</span> upon her
<span class='it'>névralgie</span>. Without comment, Alix at once closed her
window. No doubt she knew her compatriots and recognized
the futility of discussion on this theme; but
Giles reflected that Ruth and Rosemary would not so
have submitted. They would have entered into altercation
with the lady in the scarf and found pleasure in
demonstrating her folly to her even if they did not succeed
in keeping the window open. But to Alix altercation
had no charms. Even when the lady, still mysteriously
aggrieved in her furthest corner, murmured resentfully
on about <span class='it'>les anglais qui viennent nous déranger</span>,
Alix glanced meditatively at her for a moment and
then resumed her survey of the landscape, indifferent
to the misapprehension; and since Giles could not repress
a smile, the lady, who still held up her scarf in
retrospective protest, kept indignant eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you know, you <span class='it'>are</span> a worse-tempered people
than we are. She’s still nursing her wrongs,” Giles
murmured, and Alix, glancing at the lady of the
<span class='it'>névralgie</span>, answered, “She is negligible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men sat further on; one young, with high, ardent,
excited eyes, like a collie’s, in a thin head; the
other obese and red with white hair <span class='it'>en brosse</span> and a
purple nip of ribbon in his button-hole. They leaned
across the carriage towards each other and talked without
cessation, rapping each other on the chest to a constant
refrain of: “<span class='it'>Puis—il me dit;—Et—je lui dis.</span>”
Passionately swift and even vindictive in utterance as
they were, their personal geniality remained unimpaired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little boy on his mother’s lap ate chocolates,
smearing his cheeks and palms. Clambering down,
he was permitted, unchecked, to lurch towards Alix,
staying himself on the knees he passed, and when he
reached her he stretched forth his hand with assurance
for the box of apricots she held. “<span class='it'>Est-il mignon!</span>” exclaimed
the fond mother. But Alix did not even turn
her eyes from the landscape. The disconcerted child
stood gazing at her, too much astonished even to weep,
and Giles, taking pity on him, offered the tick of his
watch and jingled his bunch of keys in an attempt to
distract his attention. But the little boy gave him no
heed, and after a prolonged stare at Alix he made his
way back to his mother; his first encounter, Giles imagined,
with an unresponsive universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, you are really rather hard-hearted,” he remarked.
Here was another difference, for neither Ruth
nor Rosemary could have remained so impervious to
even such a repulsive little boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alix said: “I cannot look at a dirty face like
that. If his mother had cleaned his face, I would have
given him one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since he’s gone back to her, and you needn’t
look at him, may I give him one?” said Giles; and, as
Alix smiling, assented, Giles handed an apricot to the
little boy, who took it without thanks and ate it, staring
solemnly at Alix the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thin blue crescent of sea cut into the fields on the
right. In the distance, on a rise of country, a pale pink
château stood with wings of sculptured woodland on
either side, a long green lawn in front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be far now,” said Alix. The lady with
the scarf, the mother with the little boy, the stout marketing
lady, had all left them by now and she could
open her window and stand by it to look out. “Vaudettes
is four miles from the station. Maman will come
to meet us, with monsieur de Maubert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is monsieur de Maubert?” asked Giles. He
had never heard the name before. But then he had
never heard any names connected with Maman. How
could he, since he never spoke of her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is an old friend of ours; a very old friend,” said
Alix. “I do not remember the time when we did not
know monsieur de Maubert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very much. <span class='it'>C’est un homme fort distingué</span>,”
said Alix, relapsing into French, with the effect, to
Giles, of not sparing more than convention for their
conversation. Her thoughts were fixed in anticipation.
He could almost see her palpitate in her stillness with
it. She might have been kinder to the little boy had
she not been so unaware of everything but the approaching
figure of Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How distinguished?” Giles, however, persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am so ignorant, Giles. Wise things do not
interest me, you know.” Alix smiled slightly down at
him over her shoulder. “He has excavated cities; Persian;
Mongolian;—<span class='it'>que sais-je</span>. He writes on antiquities.
He has a beautiful <span class='it'>appartement</span> in Paris with
collections of gems and bronzes. He is at once <span class='it'>savant</span>
and <span class='it'>homme du monde</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will he be the only guest except me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that I do not know. There are three <span class='it'>chambres
d’invités</span> at Les Chardonnerets. But I have not heard
that there is, as yet, anyone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chardonnerets? That means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means goldfinches. That was a bird we always
knew, even”—Alix paused—“even before your
brother told us more of birds. Flocks come in Autumn
to the thistles on the cliffs outside our gate. When they
all fly together one sees the squares of gold on their
wings—it makes a pattern on the sky, like a chain of
golden coins; monsieur de Maubert’s strange old
square coins. And their little twitter is like the chink
of thin gold. We love them, Maman and I, and there
is a tall ash-tree in the garden where they often perch in
summer. You will see them, Giles. You will like Les
Chardonnerets, I think.—Oh, now—I recognize now—I
know those woods. We find daffodils in them, in
Spring, among the faggots. You have not in England,
have you, Giles, our great woods with all the ranged
faggots that the woodmen pile so carefully in winter.
And in Spring, at the edge of the wood, one sees around
one the great plain, champagne-coloured. The next
station will be ours,” said Alix.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He could hardly find again the face of the February
day in the Bois. It was her form, her poise that gave
her to one now, and Giles’s first impression of the
white, sunlit figure waiting on the platform was of a
Greek Victory, splendid, strong, exultant. Her face,
under the falling lines of a white hat, was almost dissolved
in a transparent shadow; only its grave, fixed
smile, like a pearl in golden wine, remained, as it were,
shaped and palpable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen her as the <span class='it'>Parisienne</span>; the creature of
elegance and artifice; but he found her almost primitive,
set here in the sea-breezes, and so much more robust
than he had remembered; if anything so delicate
could so be called. Freshness and force breathed from
her, and the classic analogies she brought to his mind
were emphasized by her straightly falling dress—a
tennis-dress, perhaps, for her arms were bare—tying
at the breast with tassels and at the waist with a
loosely knotted sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ma chérie! Ma petite chérie!</span>” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train had come to a standstill and it was as if
Alix had flown into her arms. She had been as silent as
a spectre on that spectral day when he had first seen
her. Her voice now startled him, as the missel-thrush’s
voice had done. Tears were in it and tears were in her
eyes as she clasped her child. And then, again, as they
stood embraced, it was of something Greek they made
Giles think; some beautiful relief on the pediment of a
sunlit temple; garlands above them and happy maidens
in procession on either side carrying baskets of
fruit and chanting the reunion of mother and child.
Ceres and Persephone it might be. Happy little Persephone,
escaped at last from the kingdom of Dis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood by, holding Alix’s dressing-case, and felt
himself a modern tourist gazing at the masterpiece.
Just as little difference, he saw it suddenly and clearly,
any knowledge of his would make to madame Vervier.
She was lifted, how or why he did not know, far above
the dusty impressions of the throng, impervious to
their comments, whether of blame or admiration.
Even when in another moment her lovely eyes turned
on him and, holding Alix against her with one arm, she
stretched out a welcoming hand to him and said “<span class='it'>Soyez
le bien-venu, monsieur Giles.</span> My little girl has had only
good things to tell me of you”—even then he could
not feel that he had gained in significance. So a queen
might have received the young equerry who had safely
restored to her the princess royal. They had been good
to her child, the dusty throng. That was the importance
they had in madame Vervier’s eyes; that, and no
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Struggling with many thoughts Giles followed
mother and daughter. The ghost of Owen walked beside
him, and did it whisper: “You see: how could I
have helped myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two other young men were also following madame
Vervier and Alix. “<span class='it'>Vous jouez le tennis, monsieur?</span>”
said one of them, the elegant one, in a gentle voice. He
was a charming white-clad person, tall and slender,
with eyes intensely blue, black hair brushed back from
a starry forehead; and a face like a fox for <span class='it'>finesse</span> and
<span class='it'>flair</span> and like a seraph’s for sweetness. Perhaps he had
perceived the something gagged and struggling in
Giles’s demeanour and had wanted at once to make him
feel that, unimportant as any young man must be to a
goddess, he might count on having significance for a
new friend. Giles said that he did play, and he and
the charming person exchanged smiles. They might,
somehow, have fought in the same trenches, side by
side, Giles felt. There was at once a link between them.
The other young man, who must, Giles thought, be an
artist, was dressed in brown velveteen and blue linen
and had a dark, square, suffering head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>place</span> outside the station was white and glaring,
and the noises that came from the café across it were
glaring, too. Giles reflected, with a certain satisfaction,
that Alix need, at all events, feel no pride in this
typical scene, and it was disconcerting to have his companion,
as they made their way to the little waiting car,
indicate with a wave of the hand the dusty green trees,
the dusty white houses, the untidy green shutters, and
the brittle lights on glasses and brasses in the restaurant
and say: “This is the subject that our friend here
has just been painting. You shall see it. A little masterpiece
of light and colour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Giles growled inwardly as he doubled himself
up on the <span class='it'>strapontin</span> at right angles to Alix and her
mother—the two young men in front—of course,
the fact that a beautiful picture might be elicited from
the stimuli of the <span class='it'>place</span> did not make the <span class='it'>place</span> itself
more beautiful. And yet the memory of it, framed in
this new conception of its uses, grew vexatiously in his
mind as they left it far behind, eliminating the weary
traveller’s impressions of noise, dust, and disorder, and
growing to a pattern of white and green and grey
wreathed harmoniously about a tawny ellipse. Yes,
one could make something æsthetic out of it, ugly
though it was for practical purposes; even inartistic he
could see that—hang it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road counted off its sections in tall poplars.
They passed behind madame Vervier’s head, and,
though Giles was so aware of her, he looked at the
poplars and the fields beyond them rather than at her.
She and Alix talked in French together and Alix’s voice
was revealed to him as like her mother’s when she
spoke her native tongue; musical; rhythmical; dipping;
poising, and then rising to a final lift, like a swallow’s
flight. Their hands were clasped. Their eyes were on
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could look at Alix after all, and from the poplars
he shifted his eyes to her. He had never seen the child
with that face before. Tender, radiant, and with something
of pride so deep that it hovered on the brink of
tears. Her glance met his and was tender for him, too,
as though with Owen’s ghost it said: “You see: how is
it possible not to love her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But was she as beautiful as all that? Giles gathered
himself away from the admission. Was she even beautiful
at all? He would have to look at her carefully if
he were to say, and he stayed himself on the conviction
that if it came to structure and line she could not be
compared to Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not what she looked like; it was what she
meant that he was so aware of now. He had never before
found himself in the company of a woman who
seemed so to typify the <span class='it'>femme du monde</span>, and if she
were no longer of it, that fact was merely accidental.
With every glance, gesture, rise and fall of voice, it was
there that she belonged. He did not think that he liked
the <span class='it'>femme du monde</span>, so apt, he felt, at showing you
no more than what she intended to show you of her
real purpose, so sure that for every occasion she would
know what to do far better than you could even understand.
And yet, more than the <span class='it'>femme du monde</span> she
made him think of the mountain torrent—Alix had
been right—in its strength, its splendour, and its
danger, too. And he knew that he did not like dangerous
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had expected to find her gay, and, in spite of the
memory, brooding, almost sombre, of the spectral
spring day, to feel in her something of artifice and allurement.
But if artifice there were, it was nothing
added or adventitious; and of allurement there was
none. She stood in her place, a goddess, and watched
her worshippers, and when her human smile came,
modelling her cheek to a sudden childlike candour, it
had the oddity of an unexpected weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to Alix alone that she talked; she had no word
for him. Yet once or twice, as they drove, Giles was
aware of being observed. All unimportant as he was,
he felt her dark eyes turned on him, resting upon him,
in meditation rather than in surmise. It was—he had
noted this already—a curiously widely opened eye.
Its rounded darkness gave to her contemplative gaze
a fixed, abstracted quality. When you found her observing
you, she did not look away; so that presently
you wondered whether she was seeing you at all;
whether the soft, wide gaze had not travelled to spaces
far beyond you, including but forgetting you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left the poplared road behind them and
were among great fields, stretching on one hand to
the horizon and on the other to the cliff-edge. A line
of docile cows, tethered side by side, ate their way into
a strip of wine-coloured clover; meadow pipits mounted
from the turf and filled the salt, sweet air with myriads
of falling silver bells; in the distance the tall palisades
of a wood rose against the sky and it looked like an island
floating on the level sunlight of the plain. The
glimmer of white houses among the grey boles revealed,
as they approached, an embowered village on
the cliff and Giles needed to make no mental reconstruction
of beauty here. He felt the authentic essence
fill his breath as he gazed at the picture, never to be
forgotten, he knew, of the vast blue sky, the vast sunlit
plain, the tall trees green and silver, threaded
with white cottages. His eyes were full of his delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know our villages?” said madame Vervier. It
was the first phrase she had addressed him since they
started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a few. Further north; and usually ruined
ones,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the tragic ones,” said madame Vervier.
“Here we were untouched by the war, and our villages,
too, are more beautiful than further north. In this
part of Normandy they are often surrounded by these
great ramparts of trees. It gives much character, much
charm, does it not?”—and she smiled at him. She
had noted his delight, and Alix was smiling at him, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen French pictures like it,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; some of the early Corots give one the grey and
green and white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—it is too stately for a Corot.” The young
man in white flashed a smile round at her as he drove.
“Corot would see its intimacy, its charm, rather than
its gravity. That great design against the sky;—no;
we must find somebody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier smiled back, sure of her point.
“He would not look at the sky, my early Corot; he
would look at the little white houses nestling in the
trees; he would look at the curve of the white road with
the whitewashed wall. That girl in the faded blue,
with the brown hoop of bread upon her arm, he would
put her in. Oh, yes; it is a Corot; an early Corot,
André. I see the happy gentle touches of his brush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Elle a raison</span>,” said the young man with the dark
square head, and André, driving with his easy skill,
waved a hand of contented concession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had passed within the precincts, the little
town opened clearly to the sunlight and they were
at once in the <span class='it'>place</span> that circled round a large pond
where patient men in large straw hats sat fishing.
Houses, stately in their modesty, looked over rows of
pollarded fruit-trees and high walls tiled in red. Built of
pale old brick and flint, with high-pitched roofs above
dormer windows, they seemed to speak of a delicious
leisure that was, in itself, an occupation. People who
lived in such houses, Giles thought, would never be
idle; yet all their industry would have the savour of an
art. How darkly lustrous the windows shone; how unremittingly
were those bright gardens tended. He saw,
as they passed an open gate, a stout old man in a white
linen coat tying muslin bags over the pears that ripened
on the wall. Under a <span class='it'>charmille</span> a woman sat stemming
currants. A family group in front of a shop were
already taking the afternoon repose, the father with
his newspaper, the wife and daughters with their sewing.
Along the broad white street a peasant girl, her
bare head as neat as a nut, clattered in sabots, carrying
a great earthenware jar, and a small white woolly
dog, of a breed unknown to Giles, barked languidly
from his doorstep as they passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the <span class='it'>place</span> the little town rayed out into leafy
lanes and, as they entered one of them, a sunny round
of sky and cliff-edge at the other end, framed in foliage,
showed Giles that they were at their journey’s end.
High hedges and thickets of wind-swept trees protected
the little house, brick, flint, and tiles, from the gales
that must, in stormy seasons, beat upon it from the
sea. Flowers grew gaily, though untidily, beside the
narrow flagged path that led from the wicket-gate to
the back door. They crossed a band of cobblestones
where oleanders grew in tubs, and, as they entered,
passed a kitchen gleaming with ranged coppers. Giles
as he followed madame Vervier and Alix, had the sensation
of stepping into a fairy-tale. The Three Bears
and Goldilocks might have welcomed one to such a
bright, dark little house among its sunny thickets; its
very smell was a fairy-tale smell; beeswax, seashells,
and coarse clean linen. Such a smell as a child, once
meeting it, would never in a long life forget. A tall
clock tick-tocked on the stair; there was a great Normandy
<span class='it'>armoire</span>, softly gleaming, old and worn, at a
turning of a passage; madame Vervier’s white figure
went on before, and as she bent her head to lift a latch
he saw her russet hair twisted up from the nape of her
neck; and that, again, was like a picture he had seen.
And then they were suddenly out upon a broad verandah,
broad and wide, washed with sunlight and opening
only on the blue. Sea-gulls floated by, high above
the sea, at the cliff’s edge, on a level with the eyes.
Vines fluttered, translucent, against the sunlight; the
scent of the honeysuckle came balmily; the sea was
sprinkled with white and russet sails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stately personage was reading in the shade. He
was dressed in white; he had thick hair and a grey
divided beard. Lifting his tortoiseshell eye-glasses
from the bridge of his nose, he rose to greet them, and
Giles found himself penetrated by the deep gaze of
Jovian grey eyes set under a Jovian forehead; penetrated
by the gaze and appraised, for the first time in
his life, by standards mysteriously remote. This must
be monsieur de Maubert, and Giles had never seen anyone
like him, except once, perhaps, at Oxford, when a
distinguished Frenchman had received a degree. Only
the distinguished Frenchman, black, shrill, and restless,
had so much less looked the part than did monsieur
de Maubert. It was not exactly sustaining to say
to himself that, hang it, monsieur de Maubert, after
all, had probably never seen anyone like him; the advantage,
he felt, must seem only to be his. But, under
all his boyish perturbation, Giles knew that he was appraising
monsieur de Maubert, too. Monsieur de Maubert
was a magnificent person—magnificent, although
his legs were short;—and he was a pagan. It was
rather magnificent to be a pagan and Giles knew just
how well he thought of the creed; but there were all
sorts of things that monsieur de Maubert—he felt
sure of it—could never see, and the difference between
them was that, while Giles knew that he often
groped in mystery, monsieur de Maubert would remain
unaware that there could be anything significant
unknown to him. Life, to him, was bathed in <span class='it'>la
lumière antique</span>, and anything not so bathed was inessential.
All sorts of things that Giles had only wondered
about or surmised were suddenly made clear to
him as he looked at madame Vervier’s other guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert turned from Giles to put his
hand on Alix’s shoulder. He observed her in silence
for a moment with a most benignant smile, and then
remarked: “<span class='it'>Te voilà presque une grande personne, ma
chère enfant</span>,” and, stooping his head, he kissed her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you will want to see your room,” said Madame
Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had taken off her hat, and Giles for the first time
saw her bareheaded. She stood there, looking at them,
a little preoccupied, her hat hanging against her dress
as she held it, and the sun flickered in upon her high-wreathed
russet hair. Cut across her forehead and half
tossed back, it seemed as simply, as cursorily done as
that of a little girl who, for the first time, sweeps up
her tresses. She was looking at them all; at monsieur
de Maubert, at Alix, as he kissed her hand, and at
Giles; but Giles felt, as he turned to her, that it was
upon himself that the wide, abstracted gaze was dwelling.
Monsieur de Maubert had appraised him; it was
probable that madame Vervier had appraised him, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After you have had your tea,” she said, “you will
perhaps like to rest. Or would you care to come with
us to Allongeville, where we are to play tennis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles said that he would write some letters after tea.
He did not see his friend in white, who had apparently
gone away with the car. And the dark young artist,
too, had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Alix’s arm passed in hers, madame Vervier led
him up a narrow staircase where the smell of beeswax,
seashells, and linen seemed to cluster yet more thickly,
and along a passage carpeted in matting where the sea-breeze,
blowing in from windows at each end, made a
singing noise. “Is Giles to have the <span class='it'>chambre rose</span>,
Maman?” said Alix, and she exclaimed, as her mother,
smiling, said, “Yes,” “Oh, I am so glad! I hoped for
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the end of the passage, and when one entered
one had before one in the windows nothing but
sea and sky. Grey woodwork framed panels of <span class='it'>voile de
Gênes</span>, rose, white, russet, and sepia. The little Louis
Quinze bed was of grey painted wood, stately under its
pink and russet embroideries. A bowl of rose-coloured
carnations filled the air with spicy fragrance,
and there was a tiny <span class='it'>cabinet de toilette</span> with an ancient
set of rose-and-white china. Giles had never found
himself installed in such a lovely room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; this is your room,” said madame Vervier, as
if she replied to a question. “You will be happy here,
I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles could only murmur that he would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are very primitive,” said madame Vervier.
“There are no bells. If you want Albertine, you must
go to the stair and call down for her. She will hear and
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, she will not always come,” Alix demurred;
whereat madame Vervier smiled and said that in that
case he must call Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they left him, and he could go to the window,
turning away instinctively from the room and all it
meant of madame Vervier, and stare at the sea, and,
with a rising sense of dismay and fierceness in his heart,
ask himself what he did there in the Circe sweetness.
He was there because of Alix, of course; but how far
away Alix had become. The process of removal seemed
to have begun as they had leaned on the railing of the
deck and seen Dieppe emerge over the water. In her
declaration to him, when their talk so disastrously
ended, she had drawn still further away; and now he
saw her almost as a stranger, in a strange land. A foreigner;
French; the daughter, only, of madame Vervier;
no longer his little Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she knocked at his door, twenty minutes later,
and told him that tea was ready, he felt that it was
with a dull gaze that he met her. She had asked him to
come because of something he could do to help her, but
now her radiant demeanour seemed to demonstrate
that she had brought him so that he might be enchanted.
Madame Vervier was not a person in any
need of help. There was nothing she asked less of you.
Circe, Circe; that was the word in his mind. Only
Circe, he supposed, allured; enticed; while madame
Vervier only gazed at you with those wide, intent, indifferent
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like Les Chardonnerets?” said Alix, standing
in the door and smiling at him. She had changed
her travelling dress for a white one, a straight white
one made of a thin woollen stuff, like her mother’s; and
her mother must have had it in readiness for her, for he
had never seen her wear it before. Nor had he ever
seen her look so happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” he said, with his hands in his pockets,
standing in the middle of the lovely room, “you feel
England has ceased to exist; and a good job, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not at all, Giles,” said Alix, and there was a
touch of gay malice in her smile. “How could I feel
that when you are here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will cease to exist, as far as you are concerned,
once I’m gone,” Giles amended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France has never existed for you at all,” Alix
remarked, though her smile did not become less
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, young woman, it existed for me
from the moment I set eyes on you,” said Giles gloomily,
“to say nothing of the year I fought over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix then did a very unexpected thing. She advanced
into the centre of the room and clasped her
hands around his arm and looked into his face. “Do
not be heavy with me, Giles,” she said, “when I am so
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at her fondly and sadly. “I suppose
it’s because I see you happy, for the first time,
that I feel heavy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why, Giles? Why? Must not a child be happy
at finding herself again with her mother; in her own
country? Would you not be happy in such a case?
Were you not happy when you returned to your home
and to your mother after the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not quite the same,” Giles objected. “After
all, you’ve not been in daily peril of your life. Of course
you’re happy. But try not to show me, too plainly,
how little we all mean to you. Try not to show me how
quickly you’ll forget all about us when I’m gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I should never forget you, Giles, even if I never
saw you again!” said Alix, holding his arm and looking
into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, as they stood thus, passed along
the corridor and paused and looked in at them; looked,
Giles felt, with surprise. Alix smiled round at her.
“He thinks I do not care for England any longer,
Maman, or for him, because I am so happy to be back
in France with you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, after her pause, advanced slowly
into the room, and her smile did not conceal from Giles
her covert examination of himself. It was a smile deep
and soft; superficially acquiescent; but concealing
much. Vigilance was in it, and the sense, perhaps, of a
special need for vigilance; the recognition, too, perhaps,
of something unforeseen that England had already
done to her child. Such untroubled intimacy between
young man and maiden was not, Giles divined,
in the traditions to which madame Vervier was accustomed.
Yet her smile suggested no reproof and
seemed to acquiesce serenely in Alix’s demonstration
of alien habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved to them, and passed her arm in Alix’s, so
that they stood, all three, linked together, and, smiling
on, she remarked: “You must not give your good
friend cause for such fancies, darling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke in English and her English was almost as
perfect as Alix’s. The <span class='it'>r</span> of “darling,” just rolled, like
the almost imperceptible ripple on the smooth surface
of a shell, made the word at once more playful and
more caressing. And she went on, looking from one to
the other: “You must not seem to forget him in finding
me. Our kind allies must have no cause, at any
time, for suspecting that we French have not faithful
hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have just told him, Maman, that I should
never forget him,” said Alix as they moved towards
the door. “And there can be no question of that, Giles,
for you will come often and often to Les Chardonnerets,
will you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles did not answer this question. It was unexpected,
and its sweetness was unexpected. His mind,
however, was occupied with the discomfort that came
to him at seeing himself made to appear so personally
involved in regrets for Alix’s removal. It was
not himself, first and foremost, he had been thinking
of at all when he felt those regrets; it was of England;
of his mother and Toppie; of the noisy, untidy,
but devoted family life; of the birch-wood at evening
where he had taught Alix the song of the willow-warbler;
of his beautiful Oxford and “The Messiah” on
Winter evenings. These were the things he wanted
Alix to remember, and it could not console him to
know that she expected to see him again when he felt
sure that she would see his England disappear from
her life without one pang.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A table had been laid in a corner of the verandah, and
a stout woman, bareheaded and in <span class='it'>savates</span>, was carrying
out tea and coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier rearranged the tray, setting the
tongs on the sugar, the strainer on a cup, placing the
plate of <span class='it'>madeleines</span> here, the <span class='it'>brioches</span> there; all mildly,
with no savour of criticism for Albertine’s haphazard
methods. In England such a ministrant at the tea-table
would have been felt as a flaw on the prevailing
perfection; yet Albertine, Giles divined, was also the
cook; and a bevy of trim, capped English maids could
hardly have evolved the lustre of cleanliness that
reigned throughout the lovely little house. It was difficult
to think of madame Vervier as poor; and more
difficult to think of her doing things for herself. Yet all
the loveliness had, he felt, been gathered together with
something of the same mild dexterity that now brought
order and comeliness to the tea-table. Madame Vervier
was the sort of person who would pick up lovely
things for a song; the Louis Quinze bedstead, the <span class='it'>voile
de Gênes</span>, the tall cream-white <span class='it'>cafetière</span>, like one he had
seen in a picture by—Chardin, wasn’t it?—and the
teapot with a delicate spray of grey flowers, just
touched with gilt, on its side—had all, he could imagine,
been brought to her nest by the unerring instinct
that leads the bird to select the white feather or the
lichen. Alix had said, he remembered, that part of
their revenue was derived from the rent of the fairy-tale
house; he was sure that it was an investment
that paid well. And she had probably herself made the
dresses she and Alix wore. She could be extravagant if
the money were there; if it were not, she was careful.
One felt in her the essential freedom from material
bondage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert was still in his shady corner
with the <span class='it'>Nouvelle Revue Française</span> on his knee. The
young artist had reappeared and was sitting on the
steps, his chin on his hands, looking out at the sea.
Madame Vervier took her place at the tea-table, monsieur
de Maubert drew his chair beside her, and Giles’s
friend strolled up from the cliff-path accompanied by
yet another noticeable personage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a youngish woman, though younger in form
than in face, bareheaded and wearing a very short
white skirt and a flame-coloured silk jacket. It was almost
like seeing a tongue of electric fire, brilliant, supple,
cold, run in among them, so different was she from
the sunlight which seemed so completely madame Vervier’s
element. It did not surprise Giles to gather,
presently, that mademoiselle Blanche Fontaine was an
actress, and a distinguished one. She was charming; he
had seen that at once; but he had seen as soon that it
was a charm with which he had nothing at all to do;
the sort of charm one expected to pay ten-and-six for
the sight and sound of and to feel, while it operated
upon you, safely barred away from by a row of footlights.
A presence so brilliant could not be said to cast
a chill, but for Giles it certainly cast a discomfort.
Who was she? What did she mean? Where had she
come from, this young woman so lean, so white, so
sickly-looking, yet so tough? Her smile, as she bit into
her <span class='it'>madeleine</span>, brought a long dimple that was almost
a wrinkle into her cheek and her long, pale eyes scintillated
under darkened lashes. He realized how noticeably
independent of artificial aids to significance was
madame Vervier from noting how frankly mademoiselle
Fontaine had made use of them. She might even,
by nature, he surmised, be a swarthy woman; but art
had transformed her to a dazzling whiteness and her
crinkled hair, that might be really black, repeated the
lustrous flame of her jacket. Something in the fervour
of her thin, gay lip, in the vigour of her thin,
questing nose, even suggested to Giles a Semitic strain;
but upon the racial edifice she had laid a pattern of
strange, chiming colour that seemed in its vehemence
and oddity to alter the very contour of her face. She
had made of herself what she would; what she was,
was unfathomable by any plummet in Giles’s possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all talking and laughing, all except Alix,
who sat silent beside her mother, and the young artist
with the dark, suffering head. He drank coffee; three
cups of it, and black. Monsieur de Maubert’s sonorous
tones were lifted by a note of drollery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has lost himself in the clouds of mysticism.”
They were talking of the book of a friend. “To stumble
among rocks is less disconcerting than to stumble
among clouds. <span class='it'>Il erre—il erre</span>— One sees him wandering
away into the fog of his own imaginations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you enjoy yourself in England, mademoiselle
Alix?” mademoiselle Fontaine asked. “Did you make
good studies there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I went to a Lycée with the sisters of monsieur
Bradley,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked more of a child, seen in this setting, than
Giles had ever seen her look. Her silence was childlike;
and her attitude, leaning slightly against her mother,
her chair placed a little behind her. Yet, at the same
time, Giles had never felt her manner more mature.
She was familiar with mademoiselle Fontaine. She
knew her of old. Yet what a sense of distance there
was between them. Giles could not tell whether it was
kept there, so unerringly, more by her manner or by
mademoiselle Fontaine’s. They knew their place; both
of them. Giles suddenly perceived that people in England
did not know their places with anything like the
same accuracy as people in France. Mademoiselle
Fontaine was the distinguished actress. Alix was the
<span class='it'>toute jeune fille</span>; under her mother’s wing. They might
meet for years and never advance by a hair’s-breadth
to greater intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. Yes. You were with the family of monsieur.”
The dimple came for Giles. The brilliant eyes circled
round him; pierced him; cogitated; deduced; summed
him up probably, Giles felt—(so much more shrewd
was he than mademoiselle Fontaine could guess, for all
her brilliancy)—as “<span class='it'>Jeune homme respectable et tant
soit peu lourd</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must bring monsieur to tea with Grand’mère,
Maman, and me, one day mademoiselle Alix,” she said.
It was surprising to find that mademoiselle Fontaine
was so immersed in family ties. “I have <span class='it'>un petit
‘foaks’</span>.” So she pronounced the French term for fox
terrier. “<span class='it'>Tout-à-fait charmant.</span> He will delight you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a charming ‘fox’ in the family of monsieur,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some admirable work is being done in England,”
said Giles’s friend, whose name, he now gathered, was
monsieur le vicomte de Valenbois. “Your school of
Bloomsbury. They are remarkable writers. They have
invented a new method; oh, deep, crafty; though it
seems to blow as easily as a flower. But then a flower
has always its roots; its soil.—Tchekov, do you think?
Dostoievsky?—They are much inspired, one feels, for
all their sincerity, by the Russians. Or is it truly indigenous?
Do the pavements of Bloomsbury really
grow it quite spontaneously? That delicious Bloomsbury,”
monsieur de Valenbois mused, his happy eyes
on Giles, “of the Museum, the squares where Thackeray
walks, the smell of fogs and jam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was much bewildered. He did not remember
ever having heard of a school of Bloomsbury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Valenbois enlightened him and went on,
putting Giles’s best foot forward for him, since it was
evident that he did not know how to put it forward for
himself. “And then your extraordinary Joyce. Ireland
is his soil, indubitably, and no alien pollen has
visited him. What a talent! Solitary; morose; erudite.
He will found a school here among <span class='it'>nos jeunes</span>. That is
already evident. You have writers to be proud of.
It is true we have our Proust to put beside them. You
admire our Proust?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to say I don’t know him; or the morose
Irishman either,” said Giles, with a genial grin for his
own discomfiture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Giles is a philosopher,” Alix now suddenly
and surprisingly contributed. Though so withdrawn
she had been listening, watching, and it was
evident that she had a different conception of Giles’s
best foot. “He is going to found a school, too. At
Oxford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say! Draw it mild!” cried Giles, casting a glance
of delighted amusement at his young friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it not true, Giles, that the old philosopher,
with the beard, thinks that you will found a school?”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid he only hopes I’ll follow his,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philosophy is, indeed, a magnificent subject,”
smiled monsieur de Valenbois, all gentle respect. “To
follow a school adequately is often to find that one has
founded a new one.—Does our Bergson interest you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles said that he did, very much, and found that
Alix had succeeded in putting his best foot forward, for
they now all talked about philosophy. Monsieur de
Maubert, he gathered, was a disciple of Croce’s; monsieur
de Valenbois had read William James and the
Pragmatists; and madame Vervier had attended Bergson’s
pre-war lectures at the Sorbonne. She found the
<span class='it'>élan vital</span> in too much of a hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We gallop, we gallop,” she remarked;—“but if I
may not see my goal, let me linger by the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for me,” cried mademoiselle Fontaine, “give
me <span class='it'>le bon vieux Papa de bon Dieu</span> of my childhood!
With him, at all events, one knows what to expect
and where one is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young artist had made no attempt to join the
conversation and, now that he had finished his coffee,
he got up, taking an easel, a camp-stool, and a box of
paints, and went away out on to the cliffs. His morose
profile passed along against the frieze of floating sea-gulls
and madame Vervier, sadly shaking her head,
said that Jules was in one of his <span class='it'>humeurs noires</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pauvre cher</span>!” sighed monsieur de Valenbois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that the young artist had an adored wife
who was in a madhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw her before leaving Paris,” said madame Vervier.
“She is quite gentle. She allowed me to hold her
hand.—But lost; altogether lost; she was like a tame
bird that has strayed from its cage and cannot find
its way in the forest. There it sits, on a branch, and
stares into the darkness. It is pitiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence fell for a while after that, and Giles heard
in it the echoes of the compassionate voice beating
softly against each heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will do great things,” said monsieur de Maubert
presently. It was as if he turned away from the gloomy
fact and displayed for their comfort the golden coin it
had minted. “It is an authentic genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. If we can keep him alive to give it to us,” said
madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anyone can keep him alive it is you, Hélène,”
said monsieur de Maubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charming people they were, and compassionate and
wise, thought Giles, sitting there among them in the
pellucid shadow while the gulls floated past in the
golden light. Strains of Gluck’s “Orpheus” floated
with the gulls through his mind. The thought of the
young painter’s wife, lost in the shades, suggested that
music, perhaps. But it was an Elysian scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were dispersed, all driving in monsieur de
Valenbois’ car to Allongeville for tennis, all except
monsieur de Maubert who withdrew to his room—to
sleep, Giles imagined—Giles himself did not write
letters. He wandered along the cliff-path and saw the
lovely shore curving, far away, in azure bays beneath
the gold-white cliffs. He looked at the scene and was
not consciously absorbed in thought; but a process of
testing, of reëstablishing, went on within him as if he
felt about his roots to see that they were firm. He
would have need of firmness, and the figure of Toppie
went with him as an exorcising presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late when the party returned and assembled
for a supper of <span class='it'>consommé</span>, chicken salad and a cream
for which Albertine, saturnine yet complacent, was
warmly praised. Alix looked drugged with happiness
and fatigue and madame Vervier soon sent her to
bed. Mademoiselle Blanche Fontaine, in the drawing-room
with madame Vervier and monsieur de
Maubert, read aloud the manuscript of a new play;
the young artist went away to his hotel on the <span class='it'>place</span>,
and monsieur de Valenbois sat for a little while with
Giles on the steps of the verandah to look at the
fading dyes of the sunset and to talk of Scriabin,
Stravinsky, and the Russian ballet. Giles had to own
that he did not care much about the Russian ballet.
He was always having to own things to monsieur de
Valenbois who showed the happiest interest in his
lapses, giving utterance, now and then, to a gentle long-drawn
“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span>” Giles himself was very tired, however,
and felt that he could not adequately defend his
theories which rested upon an objection to the use of
the body as a means of primitive expressionism. He
soon said good-night and went up to his wonderful little
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone to bed he lay for a long time
awake, a fold of the coarse cool linen that smelt of orris
root against his cheek. He heard mademoiselle Fontaine
go away to her own villa, escorted by the other
three. Then, when they returned, the <span class='it'>Sacre du Printemps</span>
came softly humming up the stairs, showing him
that monsieur de Valenbois was also going to bed.
After that the only voices left below were those of monsieur
de Maubert and his hostess, sitting in quiet converse
on the verandah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked meditatively with pauses of appreciation
for the beauty of the night, and madame Vervier
must once have risen to advance and look out into
the starry vastness, for Giles heard her say “<span class='it'>Tiens;—qu’elle
est grande, notre étoile, ce soir!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late before the final words were vaguely
wafted up to him: “<span class='it'>Bonsoir, mon ami.</span>” “<span class='it'>Bonne nuit,
ma chère Hélène.</span>”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He had not imagined madame Vervier coming down to
breakfast; but she was up long before it. Giles, looking
from his window at seven, was astonished to see her
form, wrapped in a white bath-robe, advancing leisurely
from the cliff that she had, evidently, just ascended
after a morning swim. She was alone. It was so early
that she had awakened no one to share with her the
delicate sting of the morning waves. Giles indeed imagined,
watching her, that these early hours were set
apart by her for solitude; that no one ever shared them
with her. She walked, her russet head bent down, a
little as she had walked in the Bois; meditating, it
seemed. He heard her afterwards on the verandah, in
the salon below, moving quietly to and fro. Her calm
voice directed Albertine. “<span class='it'>Ne réveillez pas mademoiselle.
Elle est si fatiguée</span>,” he heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little while later, Albertine’s voice broke out far
away, at the garden gate, in vehement yet not unfriendly
altercation with the baker’s lady; and then,
stealing deliciously into his sleepy senses, mingling
with the fragrance of the carnations by his bedside,
the aroma of roasting coffee-beans delicately tinctured
the air. Albertine came in with a jug of steaming water
and it was time to get up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he went down at half-past eight, monsieur de
Valenbois was singing in the drawing-room with
madame Vervier at the piano; the song was “<span class='it'>D’Une
Prison</span>,” and he sang well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Albertine was laying breakfast on the verandah,
and Giles stood leaning against a pillar listening to
the song. At its end madame Vervier soberly commended
the singer, yet turned a leaf, here and there,
to suggest an alteration. “<span class='it'>Qu’as-tu fait de ta jeunesse?</span>”
monsieur de Valenbois sang again, with a new poignancy;
and yet again. “<span class='it'>Bien; très bien</span>,” said madame
Vervier’s quiet voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then monsieur de Maubert appeared, and they came
out to greet him and Giles. Monsieur de Maubert wore
a small white woollen shawl over his shoulders and
madame Vervier asked him with solicitude whether he
would rather have breakfasted in the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>, as
usual. It had seemed so deliciously mild a morning
that she had told Albertine to lay the table here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert said he delighted in the
plan. He would merely take precautions against a
<span class='it'>courant d’air</span>; and to ensure him further from this
calamity his chair was placed in a corner behind the
table, Giles aiding in his disposal and amused by the
idea of Jove sheltering from a <span class='it'>courant d’air</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, breakfast here! <span class='it'>Quel bonheur!</span>” cried Alix,
emerging. She made Giles think of a swallow as she
skimmed out, her feet in their heelless <span class='it'>espadrilles</span>
hardly seeming to touch the ground. André de Valenbois
also, he saw, noted her swiftness, her light, direct
movement; noted, too, no doubt, her clear face, stern
in its carven structure, yet sweet in smile and glance.
Alix was really growing up; she was already a person
to be noted by a young man with an eye for beauty in
all its manifestations, and Giles, while monsieur de
Valenbois’ eyes rested almost musingly upon her,
knew a fraternal, nay, almost a paternal, stir of anxious
surmise. Would that be a solution? He did not feel
the need of a solution for Alix’s problem to be so pressing
as he had on the steamer yesterday. It was difficult
in this radiant <span class='it'>milieu</span> to believe her so in need of
rescue. However heinous madame Vervier’s fault, she
could not, without manifest priggishness, be seen as a
mother unfit to care for a daughter. But problem or no
problem, it would be a comfort to know Alix settled,
and during coffee and rolls he began to see, very
plainly, that this settlement must almost certainly
have presented itself to madame Vervier. If André de
Valenbois were here on these terms of happy intimacy,
when her child arrived, had she not seen to it that he
was here? Could she have chosen better? If Alix was
charming, so was he; he was, indeed, Giles considered,
having not thought much of Alix as in the category,
more obviously charming than she was; a veritable
prince of the fairy-tale in face, form, and demeanour,
and if Alix was not already affected by his presence
that could only be because she was still so much a
child. He was not a young man to leave a maiden’s
fancy unaffected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A penny for your thoughts, monsieur Giles,”
monsieur de Valenbois’ voice broke in, disconcertingly,
upon his meditations. That he had allowed them to
become absorbing was evident to him from the smiles
that met his eyes as he raised them. He felt himself
foolishly blushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles never talks much at breakfast,” Alix commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t get much chance to, at home, do I?” said
Giles, grateful for her intervention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have every chance here,” said madame
Vervier. “We rarely have a young English philosopher
among us. We must profit by the occasion.” Her
smile was very kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what monsieur Giles was thinking of,”
said monsieur de Valenbois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, you don’t,” Giles laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wager you!” monsieur de Valenbois challenged
him, tilting back his chair, his brilliantly blue eyes on
his friend. “Do you defy me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, own to my perspicacity when I tell you, then,
that you were thinking about mademoiselle Alix. You
were reassembling your arguments against the Russian
ballet and reflecting that the best of them would be
that it is idle to go to art for something we can find
more perfectly displayed in nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stared at him. It was near enough to cause him
to stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” smiled monsieur de Valenbois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know I was thinking about Alix?”
Giles demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did I know?—Because I was!” laughed
monsieur de Valenbois. “And the same thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier was looking at them both, and
again, Giles imagined, with her veiled vigilance. “The
Russian ballet?” she questioned. “What has Alix to
do with the Russian ballet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive my execrable taste, <span class='it'>chère madame</span>!” exclaimed
monsieur de Valenbois, “in making mademoiselle
Alix the subject of these divinations! But did you
remark the way in which she bounded out of the house
just now? It was a remarkable bound,” smiled monsieur
de Valenbois. “It started the same strain of
thought in me and in monsieur Giles, you see. We were
discussing the Russian ballet last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I wasn’t thinking about the Russian ballet,”
Giles rather helplessly protested, and he felt madame
Vervier not quite pleased. “That’s what I should have
thought, no doubt, if it had come to my mind. But it
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah; but the essential you will not deny,” said monsieur
de Valenbois, and Giles, feeling his blushes mount
again, wondered just how far the essential had indeed
been divined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was gazing first at him, then at monsieur de
Valenbois and then at her mother; and her mother’s
eyes, while they caressed and approved her silence, put
her aside into the retirement suitable to a <span class='it'>jeune fille</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Giles has disowned the essential,” she
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like him, Giles?” Alix questioned when,
after breakfast, she moved off with her friend to the
cliff-path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles really felt a little abashed before her calm; felt
that he deserved, rather than monsieur de Valenbois,
madame Vervier’s implicit reproof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Valenbois?” he questioned. “Very
much. Don’t you? I think him charming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming,” Alix reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you known him for a long time?” Giles inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A long time? I?” Alix’s eyes came back to him
surprised. “I never saw him before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really. He’s a new friend of your mother’s, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They met at Cannes last winter,” said Alix.
“Charming. He is that, I suppose; but I think it a little
<span class='it'>agaçant</span> for anyone to look so sure of happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure of happiness? You think he looks that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. As if, always, he had had everything he
wanted. That is a little <span class='it'>agaçant</span>, I think. Though of
course it is not his fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be only a part of his intelligence, his general
tact and taste, to look it,” Giles suggested. “He would
always be thinking about his responsibilities towards
his surroundings. If he wasn’t happy, nobody would
know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But would that not be for his own sake rather than
for theirs? He would feel it a disadvantage to look unhappy,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s so kind,” said Giles. “He seems to me,
now that I come to think of it, even more kind than
he is charming. He’s been most awfully kind to me
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why should he not be?” Alix inquired. She
took off her hat and the morning breeze blew back her
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m a rather unprepossessing young foreigner.
I shouldn’t have known how to be kind to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is quicker on the surface than you are, Giles;
but you are quite as quick beneath it, and deeper far,
I feel sure,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it!” said Giles, laughing, “how do you manage
to think these things at your age?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am of an age, it appears, to have monsieur de
Valenbois discuss my appearance in my presence,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—but just because you are so young,” Giles,
already alarmed for the good fortune of his romance,
protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but if I were as young as you mean, I should
not be worth discussing,” Alix returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles glanced at her from the tail of his eye. How
young, how old, indeed, was Alix. His sense of a suffering
only biding its time to spring upon her came
strongly to him as he scanned surreptitiously the high
young face that seemed to soar beside him, the vast
background lending an added haughtiness to its delicate
projections. How French, how French she was;
how much a foreigner with all her familiarity; so much
so that he could not, even now, foresee what she would
feel, what love, what suffer. “And monsieur Jules;—I’ve
never heard anyone call him anything but
Jules.—And mademoiselle Fontaine? Give me your
impressions of all these people,” he said. “They are so
strange and new to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Jules. I am fond of him. Very. I have known
him for many years,” said Alix. “Ever since Maman
admired a picture of his and bought it and then found
him, starving, with his little wife. Maman has been
their good angel always. Success is coming to him now;
now when it is too late. And mademoiselle Fontaine is
an old <span class='it'>habituée</span> of Maman’s salon. I have not seen her
in the country before. She has taken this little villa for
the summer to be near Maman. She does not seem to
belong to the country. We will go one day to have tea
with her and her mother and old grandmother and see
the little ‘fox,’ ” Alix added. “Her grandmother knew
Chopin. She will tell you so at once; and George Sand.
She was an actress, too. I do not think that I care
much for actresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was mademoiselle Fontaine’s mother an
actress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all. Her mother is quite different. <span class='it'>Une
bonne petite bourgeoise tout simplement</span>; quite insignificant
and creeping. They both adore the grandmother.
You must see them,” Alix repeated, a slight amusement
on her lips, as if she spoke of quaint animals she
had to display to her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Alix and monsieur de Valenbois bathed before
luncheon. Bathing at Les Chardonnerets was a
rather arduous affair. One undressed in one’s room
and ran out over the cliff-top in <span class='it'>espadrilles</span> and bath-robe.
The long iron staircase down the face of the cliff
was almost as steep as a fire-escape in places, and at
the bottom there was shingle to traverse and then, if
the tide was low, as on this morning, a stretch of wet
sand. Giles was an excellent swimmer and so was monsieur
de Valenbois. Alix, not yet proficient, though her
stroke was good, swam between them out to sea, and
Giles, as he and the young Frenchman smiled at each
other over her dark head, felt a growing assurance for
his romance. André de Valenbois, he saw, found Alix
a charming young creature, and what could be a better
beginning than that? She rested, when they turned to
come back, holding first Giles by the shoulders and
then monsieur de Valenbois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier was sitting on the grass, high
against the sky. She watched them from under a
white sunshade, monsieur de Maubert, under a green-lined
one, extended beside her. “Now let me swim
again and show her how much progress I have made,”
said Alix, and she bravely pointed her hands through
the waves, Giles and André beside her, exhorting, directing,
commending. Giles felt that madame Vervier,
on her height, watched it all complacently. Complacently,
yet with that vigilance, too. Alix was given the
full liberty of the <span class='it'>jeune fille moderne</span>; but he had already
noted that however far and free her roamings her
mother was always aware of when, how, and with
whom they took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so befell that Giles made the acquaintance of
mademoiselle Fontaine’s family that very day. Madame
Vervier and monsieur de Valenbois went off for
a long motor drive and it was arranged with mademoiselle
Fontaine, who appeared soon after the swim,
that Giles and Alix were to drink tea with her and Maman
and Grand’mère at their cottage. Monsieur de
Maubert was spending the afternoon with friends in
the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smallest, most smiling little house it was, that
of mademoiselle Fontaine’s family. It stood behind a
pink-and-grey wall in a tiny garden and when they
entered the gate at four o’clock they were welcomed by
the fox terrier, and found old madame Dumont, crumpled
up in black draperies and under a black parasol
all lace and fringes, sitting out in the sun on the flagged
path with a row of white and purple petunias leading
up to her. Mademoiselle Fontaine stood behind her
chair and gently but forcibly shouted their names to
her, and mademoiselle Fontaine’s mother, who did not
bear her name, but was plain madame Collet, emerged
from the house with a tray of tea and coffee. She was
a stout, pale little woman with a high, old-fashioned
bosom and prominent, old-fashioned hips and an old-fashioned
fringe across her faded forehead. Careful,
cautious, grave and happy, she seemed as one who
moved among precious objects to whose well-being and
security she knew herself essential. “Is that as you
wish it, Blanche?” Giles heard her whisper to her
daughter; and to her mother, “You are warm enough,
Maman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Grand’mère, Giles, in spite of Alix’s intimations,
was hardly prepared for such a fearsome old
lady. Very fearsome he found her, peering shrewdly
up at him through the fringes of her parasol with the
beady eye of an old raven under a dark-blue beetling
eyebrow. She was powdered and dyed, and an erection
of black lace ornamented her ample indigo wig
and fell in lappets on either side of her long Semitic
cheeks. Her smile was histrionic and her voice hoarse
as if with years of use for public purposes. Now and
then she emitted a loud gong-like laugh, and Giles
could somehow imagine her, so full of vitality did she
still seem, standing in classic draperies on a vast stage
and bellowing forth passages from Victor Hugo. She
talked almost immediately of Chopin and mademoiselle
Fontaine stood leaning on the back of her chair listening
to her as if she felt the rôle of listener, for herself
as well as for them, a privilege. Giles could not but
admire what, he supposed, was the effect of the French
tradition of family life. It was difficult to associate an
intelligence as versatile as mademoiselle Fontaine’s
with this derelict antiquity, and even more difficult to
think of her as the daughter of the homespun little person
who poured out their tea and coffee. But mademoiselle
Fontaine showed no sign, apologetic or explanatory,
of finding anything amiss with either of them,
and if her manner towards madame Collet was often
curt and authoritative, an affection that could show
itself at moments in quite a pretty playfulness evidently
underlay it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See what a naughty little mother I have, monsieur
Bradley,” she exclaimed. “She pretends always to forget
that I do not like my afternoon coffee made with
chicory. In the morning, yes; I admit it; later in the
day, no. Ah, Maman! no excuses!! <span class='it'>Je vous connais.</span>
Economy is the motive!—She has never escaped the
fear that unless one saves all one’s <span class='it'>sous</span> one may die in
indigence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chicory, Blanche? What do you say of chicory?”
the old lady inquired, leaning an ear towards her
grandchild. “<span class='it'>Mais c’est très sain, la chicorée. Ca rafraichit
le sang.</span>—If you drink chicory every day in
your coffee”—and now it was an eye she turned,
half closed in sagacious admonition, on the startled
Giles—“you will not need to purge yourself, my
young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Fi donc, Grand’mère!</span> We do not talk of <span class='it'>l’hygiène</span>
now!” laughed mademoiselle Fontaine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it is a thing never to forget,” said madame
Dumont. “If Chopin had not neglected his health,
how many more works of genius he would have given
to the world.—He was my master, did I tell you,
monsieur Gillet?”—mademoiselle Fontaine had not
succeeded in conveying Giles’s name to her in a retainable
form. “I had great talent for the piano. It was
said to me, when I chose the theatre as a career, that
it was one I chose and one I threw away.—You have
heard of George Sand in England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles said that they heard of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Femme exécrable!</span>” madame Dumont exclaimed.
“<span class='it'>Femme sans cœur!</span> How many lives did she not
destroy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but I am always on the side of the woman,
when it comes to <span class='it'>les affaires de cœur</span>,” said mademoiselle
Fontaine, with a smile at Giles. “We are so often
the losers that I feel a certain satisfaction when a
woman, even if ruthlessly, redresses the balance. And
with all its romanticism, what a great talent it was,
that of the good George! Do not say too much ill of
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! You can call a woman good who tricks
one lover under the nose of the other! Do you forget
Pagello and Alfred de Musset!” cried madame
Dumont. “As for Musset; let it pass; he was not
one to be pitied.—But Chopin! A man as simple as
a child. <span class='it'>Non. C’était un monstre!</span>” madame Dumont
declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I will leave you to tell monsieur Giles what
you think of George Sand while I ask mademoiselle
Alix to come upstairs with me and see a new dress that
has come from Paris,” said mademoiselle Blanche,
thus further demonstrating her intelligence to Giles,
for indeed madame Dumont’s reminiscences had begun
to make him uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had picked up the friendly “fox” and was giving
scant attention; but once her impeding presence
was removed, madame Dumont’s recitals took on a
disconcerting raciness and when, presently, madame
Collet gathered together the tea-things and carried
away the tray, the old lady, as if she had bided her
time, lurched towards Giles, with a terrible leering
smile, to whisper: “<span class='it'>Elle est belle, n’est-ce pas, madame
Vervier?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Très belle</span>,” said Giles, drawing away a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sa fille ne sera jamais aussi belle</span>,” whispered madame
Dumont. “She need not fear her. What fate
more pitiful for a beautiful woman than to find a rival
in her daughter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of that sort could ever happen between
Alix and her mother,” said Giles angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of that sort. <span class='it'>Précisément.</span> You, a young
man, and I, an old woman, see eye to eye when it
comes to such a comparison,” madame Dumont disconcertingly
concurred. “<span class='it'>La petite</span> Alix is not of a type
to seduce. She has distinction; an air of race; <span class='it'>mais
elle n’est pas séduisante!—Tandis que la mère!</span>”—and
madame Dumont, with eye and hand uplifted,
took Heaven to witness of her appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not what I mean at all. You quite misunderstand
me,” said Giles, more angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vous dites, monsieur?</span>” said madame Dumont, fixing
a very shrewd, sharp eye upon him as if she suddenly
discerned new aspects of an obvious case. “It is
the daughter you admire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Collet reappeared and Giles maintained a
hostile silence. To attempt to enlighten madame Dumont
would be futile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is time for your <span class='it'>repos</span>, Maman,” said madame
Collet. “She is so old, so very old, monsieur,” she
added, casting a glance of proud possessorship upon
Giles. “Only by constant care do we keep her with us.
And now it is time for the little afternoon nap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady, muttering something about chicory
and <span class='it'>hygiène</span>, signified her readiness to withdraw and
Giles assisted her daughter in hoisting her upon her
feet. But for all her decrepitude she was still not lacking
in female sensitiveness and had time, it was evident,
to make her reflections upon something unflattering in
the attitude of the young Englishman, for, before she
disappeared into the house, she bade him farewell with
an extreme and sudden haughtiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix soon came down after that and they went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” smiled Alix. “And did you appreciate the
celebrated madame Dumont?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her smile hurt Giles. Its unconsciousness of what
madame Dumont really meant; her ignorance of what
such old harpies thought and said of her mother.
“Horrible old creature!” he could not repress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrible?” Alix was evidently surprised. “That is
very severe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be severe. I think she is quite horrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always horrible to be so old. But she is not
stupid, Giles. She has been a great actress; at least,
almost great. Monsieur de Maubert saw her act years
ago, and says that it was good. And sometimes she
will still repeat one of her famous scenes—as Phèdre
or Athalie—to make one’s blood run chill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She makes my blood run chill without any acting,”
said Giles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est la belle madame Vervier</span>,” said a contemplative
voice behind him, and Giles, glancing round, as he sat
in the thatched chalet overlooking the tennis courts,
saw that it was the lady in grey who spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had played tennis all the morning with Alix,
André de Valenbois and another young man, a friend
of André’s, who had motored over from a neighboring
château, and now that they had come back after tea,
and, with madame Vervier added to their number,
made a quartette without him, he watched them from
the chalet, with a book. The small old houses and
large new villas of Allongeville climbed a valley that
rose in a wooded amphitheatre about the little watering-place
and the tennis grounds lay just outside it,
pleasantly disposed, the highroad with its poplars on
one hand and on the other a hillside of tall grasses and
wild flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles that afternoon had strolled back into the town
to look at the church and buy some tobacco. He liked
the church, with its austere, benignant Gothic and
whitewashed cool interior, clumsy wooden beams
meeting in fishes’ heads above his head and clumsy old
wooden figures of saints standing against the pillars.
Saint Martin was there with his cloak and the beggar;
Saint Roch and his dog and a little round-faced Virgin
Mary at the knee of Saint Anne. It was a homely, intimate
church and a sense of peace fell upon the perplexed
heart of Giles as he wandered about it. He
wished, or almost wished, that he could kneel with as
simple a faith as the washerwoman who set down her
basket of snowy clothes in the aisle and said her rosary
before the bright modern statue of the Virgin.
The mere sense of haven expressed in the attitude of
a sleeping old fisher-woman, with bare legs and hair
like tangled seaweed, was enviable. Giles would have
found comfort in placing a taper to burn on Toppie’s
behalf before the gold-crowned Virgin and he would
have liked to doze beside the fisher-woman and feel
that he had a right to do so. And although he did
not belong there, the church seemed to accept his
presence with a special placidity and kindliness as
though it saw in him merely a strayed sheep. It was
the true fold, it seemed to say, and it could afford to
await, for centuries if need be, the return of all such
wanderers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the church he crossed the <span class='it'>place</span>, paved with
cobbles and bright with awninged shops, and entered
a leafy path that led up to the cliff-top. A bench was
placed in a grassy recess where one could sit and look
out at the sea, and it was while he rested there that
Giles saw the lady in grey emerge from a white house
further up the cliff-side; a tall, sad, slender, beautifully
dressed woman of middle-years, whose face, turned on
him as she passed, made him think, with its inscrutable
calm and mild dignity, of the face of a Japanese lady.
As much as the Japanese lady, Giles felt, she belonged
to an order, and the meaning of life for her would be
in the fulfilling its requirements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was glad to see her reappear after he had established
himself in the doorway of the chalet. A friend
was with her, a stout, dark, sagacious person, and
theirs were evidently the young people who played in
a further court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles rose when they entered and inquired whether
his smoke incommoded them, and the lady in grey,
seeing again the stranger of the cliff-seat, smiled kindly
and said: “<span class='it'>Mais pas du tout, monsieur.</span>” She was
charming with her slanting eyes and delicate, faded
face. She carried still further, though, as it were to a
different conclusion, the impression that madame Vervier
had so strongly made upon him, of always knowing
what she meant to do and of saying what she meant
to say. Even her manner of bowing her head and
smiling as she replied to him had a technique. That
was the only word for it. They had a technique for
everything, these French people, Giles more and more
clearly saw it, and not only the Samurai-like ladies,
but the peasants, the shop-keepers, the maids and
waiters. If you presented them with a new situation,
they passed the novelty by and gave you the old
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friends looked about them. The stout lady had
a long piece of <span class='it'>broderie anglaise</span>, fastened, for more
facility, to a strip of glazed green leather. The lady in
grey had silk and a fine steel crochet needle. Giles
could just see her long white hands from where he sat,
with rings of black enamel set with pearls, and the
long earrings on either side of her long white face were
also of pearl and enamel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They observed the play of the four courts. Madame
Vervier and her party played in the nearest, and what
more natural than that the lady in grey should make
her quiet comment. But though there was no disparagement
in her voice, Giles felt a slight discomfort in
hearing her. Had she not noted him as a foreigner and
seen him as unattached, she would not, he knew, so
have alluded to his hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span>” said the stout dark lady, and she laid
down her embroidery to look at Alix’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier playing tennis became an Artemis
for speed, strength, lightness. She flashed there in the
sunlight before them, her russet locks bound with
white, her beautiful arms bare in the white tennis
dress, her slender white-shod feet exquisite in their
unerring improvisation. Her uplifted face, though so
intent, had a curious look of indolent power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the tall child, is she the daughter?” the dark
lady inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe so. Yes. The daughter. She bears the
name of Mouveray,” said the lady in grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mouveray. <span class='it'>Précisément.</span> Her husband divorced
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or she him. I do not remember. I do not know
where the fault lay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is the husband’s child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that, <span class='it'>ma chère</span>, is more than I can tell you,”
said the lady of the earrings with a touch of melancholy
humour. “But she, also, is beautiful. I find her
more beautiful than the mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But with less charm,” said the stout lady, evidently
of madame Dumont’s opinion, and she had even
something of madame Dumont’s expression in pronouncing
it. “<span class='it'>La mère est toute-à-fait séduisante. C’est
une femme exquise.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the child has more distinction,” said the lady
of the earrings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a head that would tell well on the stage,” the
stout lady suggested. “And speaking of the theatre I
saw mademoiselle Blanche Fontaine bathing here the
other day. She is very well in the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She is staying near madame Vervier at Les
Vaudettes. She is a friend. The child is perhaps destined
for the theatre.—I can hardly imagine mademoiselle
Fontaine in the water,” and the lady of the
earrings smiled. “I can hardly see her off the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, she is very well in the water,” the stout lady
again asserted. “<span class='it'>Elle est fausse maigre.</span> And she swims
as well as she acts. What a talent it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little shrill, a little metallic, perhaps,” said the
lady of the earrings; but the stout lady was quite secure
of her admiration and said that she considered mademoiselle
Fontaine the foremost of their young actresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little silence followed, and Giles, who had contemplated
withdrawal, settled himself again to his
book when the talk, as the friends resumed it, turned
on their families. The stout lady spoke of her Jacques
at the Ecole Polytechnique; of <span class='it'>le petit</span> Charlot and his
love for music. The lady of the earrings spoke of Andrée,
who would soon be old enough to marry, and of
Grand-père, left up at the white house on the cliff with
Yvonne to entertain him. <span class='it'>Ma tante</span> arrived to-morrow
to open Les Mouettes and was bringing a <span class='it'>religieuse</span>, an
admirable woman, who was to take charge of Grand-père.
“<span class='it'>Quel homme surprenant</span>,” said the stout lady,
and the lady in grey said that he was, indeed, wonderful.
“Eighty-two, and interesting himself still in all
our lives. I was discussing Andrée’s marriage with him
yesterday. We are fortunate, indeed, in having kept
him so long with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, as he half listened, gained a further impression,
after his impression of the Dumont <span class='it'>milieu</span>, different,
yet vividly the same in its one essential, of the
solidly, complicatedly built structure of French family
life; its dependencies; its responsibilities; its ramifications.
They all meant each other. They all lived with
and for each other, and the longer they lived the more
important they became, thus inversing the natural
course of family life in England. Andrée, old enough to
marry, was a very insignificant person compared to
Grand-père.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is the young man with madame Vervier?”
asked the stout lady, who had evidently just
arrived at Allongeville, since she thus plied her friend
with queries. “The little one is René Claussel, I know.—But
the tall one? He is as handsome as madame
Vervier herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is André de Valenbois. My uncle named him
to me yesterday. <span class='it'>Charmant garçon, n’est-ce pas?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“André de Valenbois! But is he not to marry Babette
de Cévrieux’s daughter? Surely I have heard
something of a marriage in contemplation there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. That is a sad story. It was, indeed, arranged;
the preliminaries, that is to say, in progress; the young
people brought together; two very pretty little fortunes
and a happily matched young pair. But it is
owing, precisely, to madame Vervier that all has come
to a standstill, as you can imagine from seeing him
with her. He is the present lover. They were in Italy
together last winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely I heard of monsieur de Maubert as the
present lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—no; that is ancient history. My uncle, who
knows monsieur de Maubert, believes that the relation,
for years, has been platonic. There have been many
names since he was favoured. He is with her now, and
it may, of course, be that he is an <span class='it'>amant complaisant</span>,
though it does not seem probable. André de Valenbois,
at all events, is the lover of the moment, and from what
I see and hear poor Babette will have to be patient if
she still thinks of him for Rose-Marie. A vulgar love
would have been less devastating in a young man’s
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles now got up. Thrusting his book into his pocket
he stood for a moment staring out at the tennis players.
He could not pass them without speaking to them
and thus reducing to painful confusion his unconscious
informants. Yet he must get away. After a moment
of hot uncertainty, he turned sharply round the chalet
and began, behind it, to climb the hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well?—in what way was it a surprise? He almost
challenged his sick dismay with the question as he
went knee-deep through the daisies and scabious. Had
not the horrible old woman’s intimations of the day before
prepared him for it? Had he really cherished the
belief that madame Vervier, after her first disaster,
might have known no other love than Owen? But the
sickness answered for him. He had cherished just
these beliefs, and if madame Dumont had left his illusions
unimpaired while the ladies of the chalet destroyed
them, that was because the first was an old
harpy while the latter were women of madame Vervier’s
own world; of what had been her world. The
truth, now, was not to be evaded. Alix’s mother was a
light woman; an immoral woman; only not of the <span class='it'>demi-monde</span>
because, he might still believe it, she was not
mercenary. His heart was cold with repudiation as he
climbed. Owen was belittled by what he had learned;
Toppie was more basely wronged; Alix’s poor, proud
little face sank beneath the waters. What spar of pride
would be left for Alix to cling to when she knew? What
would she feel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what did those women feel? Suddenly, the
racial difference more sharply revealed to him than
ever, he was aware that the cold repudiation was for
them, too. It was the colder because of their kindness.
They were safe in the citadel of their order. They were
kind because they were safe. Because they were safe
they accepted the jungle as having its own and its
different code. They strolled peacefully along the city
walls and looked down at the bright, prowling, supple
creature without the city, and commented on its skill
and beauty. One might almost say that the jungle itself
was part of the order, since the <span class='it'>demi-mondaine</span> was
taken as much for granted as the <span class='it'>femme du monde</span>. The
bright creature was seen as dangerous, no doubt, to
adventurers such as André de Valenbois; but Giles surmised
that the danger was not great. Inconvenient
was the apter word; inconvenient to the plans of the
<span class='it'>mères de famille</span>. Young men who belonged to the
citadel had, as it were, the freedom of the jungle; that
was where it came into the order; for their pleasure.
They issued forth to adventure; but they came back,
they always came back—to Babette’s daughter—in
the end. Cruel; abominable, such tolerance, such connivance,
combined with such repudiation. For it was
there that Giles’s austere young eyes saw the evil manifest,
while the conception of a social structure more
complicated and more rigid than any England could
ever produce grew upon his vision. For nothing was
worse than cruelty, and what was more cruel than to
repudiate after you had connived?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where did Alix, child of the citadel, but habitant
of the jungle, come into the picture? His mind
turned to her as he had left her, leaping in the sunlight,
her head thrown back, her arm uplifted; straight,
white, unaware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt himself looking steadily at Alix, eliminating
her companion from his field of vision. He could not
look at André de Valenbois yet. He could never look
at him and at Alix, together, again. The memory of
his romance for them gave him almost a qualm of terror.
André as an individual was hideously eliminated
from any such romance; but, as a type, Giles could feel
between him and madame Vervier’s daughter no disparity
or inappropriateness; none if he were a man with
a spark of generosity or insight. But, as he looked at
Alix and her future, Giles saw that for young men of
the French citadel generosity and insight were sentiments
strictly appointed and conditioned. They did
not enter into the choice of a wife. How could they,
since the choice was made as much by Grand-père at
eighty-two, by all the family, as by the young man
himself. There was in her own country no future for
Alix at all; that was what he saw quite plainly as he
turned down from the hillside a mile beyond Allongeville
and marched across the road and made his way up
the opposite rise of meadow towards Les Vaudettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was striding along the upland now, among the
fields of golden grain. The sea-breeze blowing on his
face seemed to speak of Alix, and his thoughts, almost
with a sense of tears, dwelt on her, on what he divined
of the child’s nature; so young, yet so mature; so sensitive,
yet so hard; and above all so passionately loyal.
What would she feel when she knew the truth?—He
came back to the first question. They must all have an
order, a code, these strange French people. They none
of them stood alone. The individual was implicated
through every fibre in the group to which he belonged.
Would Alix, when she knew, accept the jungle and its
code? What else was there for her to do? Giles was
asking himself this fundamental question by the time
he reached Les Chardonnerets and was finding the
only answer to it. There was nothing that Alix could
do. But he could do something. He and his mother
and all of them. Keep her. Away from the jungle; and
away from the citadel, too. “Damn it!” Giles heard
himself remarking as he marched towards the verandah.
“It thinks itself too good for her and she’s too
good for it. She shall belong to us. It’s the only way
out,” said Giles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He had mounted the steps, head bent, hands thrust
deeply into his pockets, and had actually cast himself
into a garden-chair before he saw that he was not
alone. Over there in the corner near the little table
where the reviews and newspapers were laid, and the
fluttering vines tempered the sunlight, sat monsieur de
Maubert, a book upon his knee and his eyeglasses on
his nose. He was looking above them, across at Giles,
and the young man was terribly disconcerted in seeing
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” he muttered; “I didn’t know
anybody was here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have only just returned,” said monsieur de Maubert
in his Olympian tones, “and there is no occasion
for apology. You were coming fast and you were thinking
deep. You seem disturbed, Monsieur. Has anything
occurred to incommode you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had pulled his chair around a little so that he
faced monsieur de Maubert and as he heard the suave
question he suddenly determined to answer it. Whatever
monsieur de Maubert’s past relation to madame
Vervier, he felt assured from what he had observed
that his present one was based on a disinterested devotion.
If he must try to persuade madame Vervier to
give Alix up to them, it would assuredly be as well to
gain monsieur de Maubert’s sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell you the truth, I am incommoded,” he said.
“I’ve had a very nasty shock. Is that right? <span class='it'>Un mauvais
coup?</span>—Well, you understand, I’m sure. We’re
so fond of Alix, all of us, my mother and brothers and
sisters; she almost seems to belong to us; and I’ve just
been hearing two women talking at the tennis about
her, and her mother; and about her future. Nice
women. And they seemed to think there wasn’t any
future for her except the theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” monsieur de Maubert removed his glasses
as if for a more unimpeded observation of his companion.
“And what is amiss with the theatre? You did
not, evidently, suppose that they narrowed the opportunities
of a young girl such as Alix to that career only;
but it will suffice for the argument. What is amiss with
it? It may be a great career for a woman of talent. Our
friend mademoiselle Fontaine, for example, has made
for herself a distinguished name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles felt that his face was hot, but he went doggedly
on: “I know. I’m not belittling it. But, from the way
they spoke, I infer it’s not what it is with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A playground for pretty amateurs? A display of
dressmakers’ <span class='it'>mannequins</span>? No; it is not. We are a
more serious people than you when it comes to art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was not to be abashed. “With us it is one
honourable alternative among others. It’s a career
any young girl can follow, except among old-fashioned,
prejudiced people. And I mean young girls of
good character; of good standing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you mean, I think,” said monsieur de Maubert,
“is that with us it is not seen as a suitable career
for a <span class='it'>jeune fille du monde</span>. Alix is not a <span class='it'>jeune fille du
monde</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I don’t mean only that,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or perhaps that it is not with us a career <span class='it'>pour une
vierge</span>,” monsieur de Maubert further defined. “There
you are right. I do not easily imagine a great actress
who is not also a woman of experience. That is all that
it comes to, is it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles wondered for a moment if this, indeed, was all
that it came to for him. He had not thought of it in
those terms, and it gave him an added chill to find that
monsieur de Maubert did. “What it comes to for me,”
he said, “is that I don’t think it a suitable career for
Alix;—precisely because of what you say; and what’s
more, I don’t believe her mother does, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this monsieur de Maubert was silent for some
moments, and in the silence Giles felt anew that, ambiguous,
even sinister as he might be, his sympathy
could be counted upon where any interest of madame
Vervier’s was in question. If he reflected thus carefully,
it was, Giles felt, because from Alix they had passed to
madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right. Her mother is with you,” he said at
last, surprisingly. “It is because she is with you that
she sent the child last winter. She sees the difficulties
that you see. She would prefer, to any artistic career
in France, that Alix should marry in England. Marriage
is what she intends for her. She would, I am sure,
be glad to talk of any possibilities for Alix with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she’ll let me have a talk with her; I’m glad
of what you tell me,” Giles muttered, though bewildered
by monsieur de Maubert’s calm assumptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was going on as calmly: “For myself, I do
not know that I am in agreement with her. Where her
child is concerned, she shows, at times, for a woman so
gifted and so sagacious, a certain conventionality of
outlook. She who, for herself, has chosen the path of
freedom, should have more courage for her child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it something of a criticism of the path of freedom
that she doesn’t choose it for her child?” Giles
felt himself impelled to comment. “Aren’t all mothers
conventional when it comes to their daughters? Isn’t
convention, in that sense, only another name for
safety?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah; you are a shrewd young man,” said monsieur
de Maubert with a smile. “Perhaps it is. Personally I
feel that for our little friend the free life of the artist
would be a happier one than the life of the English
country lady. That life, for a vivid, vigorous nature
such as hers, would be, I should imagine, <span class='it'>bornée</span>; <span class='it'>fade</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why it should,” said Giles. “But I
wasn’t thinking of country ladies, or of marriage at all.
We don’t think of marriage like that. I thought of
Alix making her living in England. I thought of a life
where she would have love and respect about her and
be useful and happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think that such a prospect would at all
attract her mother,” monsieur de Maubert remarked.
“I do not see what more advantage it offers than a
similar life in France. Do you consider, then, that madame
Vervier has not love and respect about her and is
not useful and happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles at this, struck to silence, sat staring at monsieur
de Maubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have doubtless,” monsieur de Maubert continued—and
Giles saw that it was not through any inadvertence
that he had thus placed the situation of
madame Vervier squarely between them; without any
embarrassment, without any hesitation, he calmly selected
the theme—“you have doubtless heard those
women speaking of our hostess as if they did not respect
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite that,” Giles muttered. “They spoke
merely as if she didn’t count with them at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you imagine,” monsieur de Maubert inquired,
“that they count with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his confusion Giles could answer this question
immediately. “They count with her for Alix,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Alix?” monsieur de Maubert mildly, yet perhaps
not quite ingenuously, questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve owned to it yourself,” said Giles. “It’s
their life she’d want for Alix. The safe life. The respected
life. She’d rather that Alix should marry one
of their sons than be the most wonderful of actresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be so. Gifted and sagacious people have
their weaknesses. You speak again of respect,” said
monsieur de Maubert. “All those who are honoured
with her friendship respect madame Vervier. You
speak of marriage. What wife can hope for adoration?
Madame Vervier is adored as well as respected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have said that a wife could hope for adoration—and
for fidelity as well,” Giles returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very rarely,” monsieur de Maubert smiled. “And
I do not imagine that our hostess—of whom I speak
thus openly because I see that between us there is
nothing to conceal—has ever had to fear infidelity.
She is in the fortunate position of a woman free to
choose. She gives happiness when and to whom she
wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles sat battling with a confusion of thoughts. He
had not meant to discuss madame Vervier with anybody.
It was horrible to him that he and monsieur de
Maubert should thus be discussing her. But without
implying her present it was impossible to discuss Alix’s
future. “I don’t call it fortunate,” he said. “I don’t
call it happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not call it happiness to love and to be
loved?” monsieur de Maubert inquired. “You have,
perhaps, mystic consolations, monsieur Giles; but to
the majority of our poor humanity this will always
remain the one authentic happiness of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have different ideas,” said Giles. “I don’t see
love like that. When you speak of her giving happiness,
you mean, I suppose, that she has had a great
many lovers. That is what those women said. I think
that a tragic life, you see; and the more tragic, the
more lovely the woman is who leads it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great many?” monsieur de Maubert weighed it.
“Hardly that. She is a serious, not a frivolous woman;
and beauty accompanies her always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, we have different ideas,” Giles heavily
repeated, looking down and tugging at the wicker of
his chair. “A love that can be repeated over and over,
I don’t call love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bonté divine!</span>” monsieur de Maubert laughed suddenly
among the vines. “A fountain cannot throw itself
into the air repeatedly and remain itself? Spring
cannot return to us again and again? It is with our
hearts as with nature; a renewal; a discovery of fresh
beauty. And since we are all different, with each new
love there is the discovery of new beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love to me means nothing—worse than nothing—unless
it means dedication; permanence; unity,”
said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but then it ceases to be love,” said monsieur de
Maubert, “and becomes duty, affection, the joys and
cares of the <span class='it'>foyer</span>; what the wives—if they are fortunate—may
count on. A young man like you is surely
aware of the difference between love the passion, and
love the affection. We feel the latter for our wives and
mothers; we feel something very different for our mistresses.—You
will agree to that, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never had a mistress,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span>” It was an exclamation of blended amusement,
astonishment and most courteous respect for a
strange idiosyncrasy, and Giles saw monsieur de Maubert
in his dappled sunlight opening large eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I’d like to ask you, if I may,” said Giles, “is
what you feel for mistress number one when mistress
number two has deposed her; and what you feel for
number two when you are devoting yourself to number
three. You can’t feel passion for them all, at the same
time, I suppose. The present lady preoccupies you.
What of the others, then? Have they ceased to arouse
any solicitude or interest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the fact that they are gone, far less,” monsieur
de Maubert owned, shifting himself now in his
chair the better to contemplate his companion. “One
may think of them with gratitude or regret; with pain
or indifference. One may have been abandoned, or one
may have found oneself ceasing to desire. A man of
honour will do all in his power for the woman who has
been dear to him; who may still be dear. Affection and
trust may still be there, though passion has burned
itself away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must fill your time,” Giles muttered, “pretty
considerably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it might”—if monsieur de Maubert felt the
dryness of the young man’s tone he did not stoop to
any retaliation; he was all kindliness—“but charming
women are rarely in need of consolation. Is not the
fact you will not face, my idealistic young friend, the
fact, simply, that passion, the flame, does burn out?
That is a law of life. You will not alter it with all your
ascetic moralities. And shall we turn from the flame,
its ardour and beauty, because it cannot burn for ever?
That would be an anchorite’s error. Let us burn with
it and rejoice, until it sinks. Unfortunately, the time
of renewal passes,” monsieur de Maubert sighed.
“Spring goes, and Summer goes, and even of Autumn
there is little left. Winter approaches and one grows
old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles sat silent looking out to sea. The things he
held to be of infinite value were invisible to monsieur
de Maubert. The things monsieur de Maubert held to
be of value were clearly visible to him. He saw the
beauty of flame and fountain and the old paganism in
his human heart echoed to the thought of love the passion.
But he saw something else, that underlay them
all, not contradicting, as monsieur de Maubert imagined,
but completing them. What that something was
it would be useless to describe. If one had come to life
asking only of each moment what it gave and never
what it meant, one became blinded to the meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sadness fell between them sitting there, and presently
monsieur de Maubert said, showing that he felt
it, “Well, the sun is setting; I will go in. You are
sorry for me and I am sorry for you.—Do we terminate
our discussion in a mutual sympathy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had risen from his chair with a rather porpoise-like
roll of his stout white body and stood, complete,
assured, benevolent, looking down at Giles; and Giles
wondered, looking up at him, whether the price one
paid for such completeness was just that blindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there is sympathy,” he vaguely murmured.
“I’m afraid it’s true, though. I think you
quite as wrong as you think me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, when you are as old as I am,” said monsieur de
Maubert, unperturbed, “you will think differently.
You will by then, assuredly, intelligent as you are,
have learned to make a better use of your time. You
will have learned to round out your life by a richer experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, too, had risen, and he could almost have
laughed as he listened; it struck him as so comic, with
its sadness, that the traditional rôles of youth and age
should be thus reversed. “You will have learned,”
monsieur de Maubert was going on, “to accept the full
gamut of our human nature. There remains nothing,
nothing, for the anchorite in his desert—let me assure
you of it—but the handful of sand his dying hand
clutches at. He has had, you will say, his mirage with
which to console himself. That is a sorry consolation
at the end. Accept reality, my young friend. Accept
the full gamut. Neglect none of the strings of your
violin. It is broken all too soon. And what more sad
than to have stopped your ears against its sweetest
melody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, indeed?” said Giles. There was hardly
irony in his voice. It was contemplative rather. And
smiling at monsieur de Maubert as they stood there in
the sunset, he added: “We want different things.”
That simile of the unheard melody summed it up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange to meet them all again that evening, so
unchanged to their own consciousness, so changed to
his. Strange to find them still so charming and so to
shrink from their charm. They came laughing up the
steps of the verandah where he still sat, and he wondered
if they felt in his voice and look, as he greeted
them, any difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it was an excellent set,” André de Valenbois
said, laying down his racquet and seating himself next
to Giles. “Where did you disappear to, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>? We
looked, and you were in the chalet, and when we looked
again, you were gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt I’d like a walk. I went up the hill behind the
chalet,” said Giles. “The country is lovely up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier’s eyes were on him, hardly cogitative
in their gaze, yet perhaps conjecturing something.
She, doubtless, knew the names of the ladies of
the chalet as well as they knew hers. She might infer
the reasons for his flight. At all events, saying nothing,
only maintaining her cool dim smile, she crossed the
verandah and went into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening meal at Les Chardonnerets was irregular
in its hour and informal in its habit. Monsieur de
Maubert and André de Valenbois only changed their
flannels for light afternoon clothes, and Jules, when he
came, did not change at all. Giles maintained his custom
of evening dress, but he waited for some time alone
in the drawing-room that evening, and even after
André had joined him, exquisite in pale blues and
greys, another five minutes passed before madame
Vervier and Alix appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier wore a dark silk dress, purple or
red or russet—Giles in the waning light could not define
the tint—fastening at the breast with a great old
clasp of wrought gold. A fringed Empire scarf, purple,
silver, and rose, fell about her beautiful bare arms;
a high Empire comb was in her hair, and with her
dark gaze she made Giles think of a lady drawn by
Ingres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved across to the window, her arm around
Alix, and said, standing there and looking out: “<span class='it'>La
belle soirée!</span>” It was a citron and ash sky above a
golden sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maman, you will sing this evening,” said Alix.
“Giles has not heard you sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur de Valenbois is the singer. I have no
voice,” said madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One needs no voice to sing the songs I mean,”
said Alix. “Do you know our old songs of France,
Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked round at him over her shoulder, palely
shining in the white taffeta, and Giles, with a sinking
and sickening as of an unimaginable yet palpable
apprehension, saw that André de Valenbois’ appreciative
eyes were upon her; upon her, rather than upon
her lovely mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the one beginning, ‘<span class='it'>L’Amour de
moi</span>’ ” asked Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles said he did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it is the very dawn of loveliness, that song,”
said André, and in the words Giles felt the expression
of a perhaps subconscious train of thought. “It is so
young. It is all dew and candour. You must hear it,
monsieur Giles.” The young Frenchman wandered
about the room, his hands in his pockets. “Of the time
of your Chaucer,” he went on. “Our countries then
had much the same heart. It was the time when our
great cathedrals rose and miracles were as plentiful as
turtle-doves.” He paused before the mantelpiece and
took up one of the photographs set there. “This is of
you, mademoiselle Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier had turned from the window, and,
still holding Alix, she approached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it is of me. It was taken in England,” said
Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had not noticed the photograph, but he noticed
a change in Alix’s voice. He, too, drew near, and
saw the little snap-shot of Alix with the dogs at the
edge of the birch-wood. But it was in a frame delicately
embroidered in blue and silver, and he asked
in all innocence, “Where did the pretty frame come
from, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie made it,” said Alix. The alteration in her
voice was now evident. He now knew why, and fell to
instant silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie? What is Toppie?” André de Valenbois
asked, laughing a little and looking at Alix over her
photograph. “That is a name I have never heard before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is <span class='it'>le petit nom</span> of mademoiselle Enid Westmacott,”
said madame Vervier, in tones sad and gentle.
“She was the <span class='it'>fiancée</span> of monsieur Giles’s brother, our
friend, killed in battle, of whom you have often heard
me speak. Mademoiselle Toppie”—how strangely
the childish syllables fell from her untroubled lips—“made
the little frame for me as a Christmas gift. Had
you not seen it, monsieur Giles? It is exquisite. I was
infinitely touched by her thought of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. It is, indeed, exquisite,” André murmured,
while Giles found no words. “One feels that only an
exquisite person could have made it.—Yes, certainly
I have heard you speak of monsieur Giles’s brother,
<span class='it'>chère madame</span>. But I did not know that he was betrothed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in a respectful tone, holding the frame,
but for all his resource and grace of bearing, filled,
Giles suddenly felt, with a conflict of thoughts. Did he
know of Owen? Did he accept his place, in the succession?
Was he jealous in retrospect; or, like monsieur
de Maubert, in retrospect <span class='it'>complaisant</span>? And that there
was something to be kept up—or was it for him,
Giles, that she kept it up?—was manifest to him from
the deliberate adequacy with which madame Vervier
advanced to meet the occasion, while Alix, her eyes
turned away from them all, fixed her gaze upon the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is, indeed, exquisite. I can say it, monsieur
Giles, although I have never met her. It is not only
from Alix’s letters that I know her. Before that. Your
brother talked of her always. She was always in his
thoughts. One could not know him well, or care for
him as we did, without coming to know and care for
his beautiful Toppie. It was a great devotion,” said
madame Vervier, and her voice, in its sadness, sweetness,
and decorum, seemed to lay a votive offering before
Toppie and her bereavement. “I have never
known a greater.” But as she thus offered her wreath
and bowed her head, Giles saw a deep colour rise slowly
in Alix’s averted face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here is monsieur de Maubert,” said madame
Vervier, turning to greet the latest entry. “Jules
evidently is belated in some distant village. We will
wait no longer, I think. Albertine’s soup will be
spoiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you not a picture of this lovely mademoiselle
Toppie?” Giles heard André say to Alix as they moved
to the dining-room, madame Vervier leading the way
on monsieur de Maubert’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have no picture of her,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know her well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. She lives near Mr. Bradley’s family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If madame Vervier’s voice showed full adequacy, so
did her child’s. Alix’s adequacy, her grave courtesy,
untinged by withdrawal, yet setting a barrier, filled
Giles’s thoughts during the meal. She, too, knew just
what she wanted to say and just how to say it; yet how
much deeper, he felt sure, was her perturbation than
madame Vervier’s. She had seen her mother, before
the eyes of her English friend, involve herself in a web
of implicit falsehood. How false was madame Vervier’s
web Alix could not know; but she had known
enough to feel ashamed before him; not, Giles knew,
because Maman lied; but because she had need of lies.
She herself had also lied. Giles, on their journey, had
seen Toppie’s photograph in her dressing-case. She
had lied because she wished to remove Toppie, as well
as herself, from even an indirect intimacy with André
de Valenbois. It was as though some deep instinct
warned her against him. And though Giles again
deplored her readiness, he could not feel that he regretted
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat opposite him, all silvery in the soft candle-light,
her young downcast face set in its narrow frame
of hair, and he knew that grief and fear were in her
heart. Madame Vervier talked much, for her, and her
gaze, turned once or twice on her child, seemed, as was
its wont, to include her and to carry her on to further
depths of contemplation. But even madame Vervier
could not guess what was in Alix’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper they all went out on the verandah. The
vines fluttered against a moonlit sky and moonlight
washed in upon them like a silvery tide. Mademoiselle
Blanche, wrapped in swansdown, came gliding in, and
Jules, with a pipe, emerged from the shadows and sat
in his accustomed place on the steps. Giles felt that it
soothed the lacerated heart of the young artist to be
with madame Vervier. Like a wounded wild animal,
he drew near the hand he trusted. She was capable of
compassion; of great gentleness; of most disinterested
friendship. An enigma to Giles, there she sat, and her
soft, meditative alto joined in the old songs they all
sang together, while Alix, behind her in the shadow,
leaned her head, as if weary, upon her shoulder and
listened. But more than weariness was expressed in
the child’s attitude. Giles, listening to the dove-like
tenderness of “<span class='it'>L’Amour de moi</span>,” divined it all. Alix
sought comfort from the pressure of new apprehensions,
new intuitions, new complexities; and more than
for herself, it was for Maman that she thus drew near.
The very love, tender, devout, brooding, of the song,
was in the gesture with which she laid her head beside
her mother’s and looked out across her breast into
the unknown future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier did not come down to breakfast
next morning. Giles had heard a murmur of voices
in the room next his till late into the night and he
saw from Alix’s eyes that she had slept little. They
breakfasted as usual in the little dining-room which
overlooked the garden at the back of the house and
might have been dark, with its old polished panelling,
had not the sunlight at this hour so flooded it. A linen
cloth of blue-and-white squares was on the table, and
a bowl of marigolds, that seemed to bring the sunlight
clotted and palpable among them, in the middle.
Above the marigolds, Alix, in Maman’s place, poured
out their coffee, heavy-eyed but still adequate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert and André argued about politics
with an impersonal vehemence that recalled to
Giles, in its transposed key, the altercation of the
friendly men in the train. He gathered, however, that
they were both agreed on the necessity of a strong man
for France and on many lopped heads. The French
had not changed so much since the Revolution after
all. Whatever the party, the solution seemed the same.
Mademoiselle Fontaine, rushing in with a wonderful
pink sunbonnet on her head, vividly contributed her
own brand of violence, and then announced that it was
the very morning for <span class='it'>la pêche aux équilles</span>. The tide was
low; the sun shone; the breeze blew; and she had promised
Maman and Grand’mère a marvellous <span class='it'>friture</span> for
their <span class='it'>déjeuner</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had not yet seen this mildest sport. Armed
with spades, bare-legged and shod in <span class='it'>espadrilles</span>, they
made their way to the beach and, following the receding
waves, dug vigorously for the evasive prey, half
fish, half eel. He found himself laughing with them as
they climbed rocks and raced to fresh stretches of wet,
shining sand. He had never known anything more disquieting
than the mingling of aversion and liking he
felt for them. He and André and mademoiselle Blanche
sat on a rock to rest while, at some distance, near the
edge of the waves, Alix dug alone, and, as he listened to
them and watched her, Giles realized that Alix had
been with rather than of them. She had smiled, also,
she had even laughed; but there was a disquiet in her
deeper even than his own, and if she dug there so intently
it was because she found relief in the childish
toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a sky!” said André, looking up at the rippled
blue and silver. “It is like music, is it not? Music of a
celestial purity. Are you fond of César Franck, monsieur
Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It filled Giles with gloom to hear André speak of
celestial purity. It was not that he felt the charming
young Frenchman to be impure. What separated
them was their conception of life. André’s, like
monsieur de Maubert’s, like madame Vervier’s, was
a pagan philosophy and his was a Christian. He did
not believe that they could understand César Franck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! He is not for me!” cried mademoiselle Blanche,
appropriately, her chin in her hand as she looked out
with brilliant, intelligent eyes at the far horizon. It
was strange to see her sitting there, her face whetted
by artificial emotion, dyed and touched and rearranged
to suit a fashion, among things as primitive as
rocks and cliffs and sky. “It is a music without breathing;
without blood; the music of a trance. The waves
do not break, the clouds do not sail, the birds are silent;
one is fixed in an eternity. I do not like eternity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, mademoiselle,” said André, “monsieur Giles
here, who is a Platonist, will tell you that only when
we reach eternity do we find life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>André’s fox-seraph face was artificial, too, though so
differently. Everything he had experienced had been
a selection. He had had, all his life through, only to
stretch forth his beautiful hand and take from the
heaped and splendid <span class='it'>corbeille</span> offered him by destiny
what fruit, curious or lovely, most tempted him. And
his grace, his gift, lay in the fact that he was tempted
only by what was curious or lovely. There was nothing
of sloth or sensuality in his being. Tempered like steel,
he mastered every lesser taste by one finer, and Giles
saw him like one of the gravely joyous youths of the
Parthenon frieze riding life, as if it were a perfectly
broken steed. How exquisite a being must madame
Vervier be to have attached him! Such was the
thought that passed through Giles’s mind, revealing to
him, as it did so, how far he had advanced in the understanding
of pagandom. And a stranger thought followed
it. Unwilling as he was to admit it, it was yet
indisputable that Owen had gained a value in his eyes
from having been chosen by such a being; from having
been André de Valenbois’s predecessor. Whatever
Owen had lost—and Giles knew that the loss was beyond
computation—that he had certainly gained.
Meanwhile, on the subject of eternity and César
Franck, he maintained a silence which, he hoped,
might not seem too morose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they returned to Les Chardonnerets with
their <span class='it'>pêche</span>, madame Vervier sat on the verandah embroidering.
Monsieur de Maubert was beside her, and
Giles felt sure, from the moment he set eyes upon them,
that monsieur de Maubert had by now fully repeated
to her the conversation of yesterday. Giles’s impressions
and discoveries and beliefs were known to her;
and, no doubt, the fact that he had never had a mistress.
She and monsieur de Maubert had talked him
over and over and up and down, but what they had
made of him he could not even imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes met his with the bland serenity of a statue’s.
“Have you had a good <span class='it'>pêche</span>?” she asked Alix.
She took her by the hand and drew her to her side
and looked down into the bucket. “Admirable! Albertine
will be overjoyed. <span class='it'>Dieu, que tu as chaud, ma
chèrie!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the climb up the cliff, Maman,” Alix bent her
head obediently while her mother passed a handkerchief
over her neck and brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert had got up and gone inside
and mademoiselle Blanche had parted from them at
the cliff-top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will sit here in the shade with you and rest, <span class='it'>chère
madame</span>,” said André, casting himself into monsieur de
Maubert’s vacated garden chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, <span class='it'>ma petite</span>,” said madame Vervier, still
holding her child by the hand, “may, if you wish, and
if monsieur Giles will accompany you, bathe now. You
will have time before lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like that very much. But I do not need
anyone. It is quite safe,” said Alix, with a curious lassitude
in her tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, indeed, you may not go alone,” smiled madame
Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I should love a swim,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, presently, he and Alix were on the beach again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they came to the rock where, with safety,
the bathing-robes might be deposited, Alix, instead of
doffing hers, sat down and said: “Shall we talk a
little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let us talk,” said Giles, and a great wave of relief
went through him. At all events, Alix would not
keep things from him. He sat down beside her. Only
the sea and sky were before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to tell Maman last night, Giles,” said Alix.
She looked straight before her, wrapped to her chin in
the white folds of her robe, and he felt that she had to
keep herself by sheer self-mastery from reddening before
him now, as she had last night when she had heard
Maman talk of Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. Yes,” said Giles as quietly as he was able. “I
thought perhaps you’d feel it best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix, her dark brows slightly knotted, looked before
her. “And I think she sent me here with you so that I
should tell you,” she went on. “Tell you, I mean, that
she believed what she said last night about Captain
Owen and Toppie. That Toppie was first with him.
Not until I told her of his silence to you all did she see—what
you and I saw, Giles;—that he cared most
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles sat, struck to an icy caution. Yes; he saw it in
a flash; that was how she would put it to Alix. He
could find no word. But Alix expected none. Carefully
she continued her tale. “It made her very sad when I
told her of his silence. It made her cry. But she was
not angry with me for having kept it from her. She
understood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was she angry with him?” Giles asked after a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix at that turned her eyes upon him and he read in
them a deep perplexity. “I do not know,” she said.
“She did not say. I do not think she was angry with
him either. She is a person who understands everything.
But I do not think she would have been so unhappy
if it had not hurt her very much. Why else
should she cry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why, indeed? Was it for her unveiling before himself?
How difficult to think it after the blank gaze of
those dark eyes. Was it not, rather, in fear and grief at
seeing her child entangled, at last, in her vicissitudes?
However it might be, there was a new burden on her
heart and, inevitably, Alix now must bear part of its
weight with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad it’s all out,” Giles murmured. “It
makes everything simpler, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it?” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she asked that, he was aware that part of his
thought had been that it made it simpler in regard to
Alix herself and what he hoped to do for her. But was
he really so sure of this? Would madame Vervier be
more willing to let them have Alix now that she saw all
her vicissitudes disclosed to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she’ll have a talk with me,” he said. “One
can’t talk, really, if things aren’t clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is going to talk with you, Giles,” said Alix. She
still spoke with her lassitude. It was as if Maman had
stretched her too far. “I do not know when. She is
occupied, as you see, with her other friends. But she
will talk with you. You please her. Very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do I?” Giles murmured. If it hadn’t been his
dear little Alix he could hardly have kept the irony
from his voice. “I hope it will be soon,” he said. “I
hadn’t intended my visit to last over the week, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will be soon,” said Alix. “But I cannot
say for Maman. Shall we swim now, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they all met again at lunch, over the marigolds,
it seemed to Giles that madame Vervier looked
at him with a new kindliness. She seemed to take it for
granted that from his little interview with Alix there
must have come a gain for their relation. She asked
him if he was coming this afternoon to tennis, and
when he said no, that he had work to do, she went on,
smiling at him: “You will be abandoned, then, for we
all have our tea at Allongeville. But perhaps you will
take refuge with madame Dumont and her daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had told tales. That was evident. Giles summoned
an answering smile with which to own that
nothing could be further from his wishes than to have
tea with mesdames Dumont and Collet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not care for our ancient neighbor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, in her day, <span class='it'>la pauvre vieille</span>, she had her qualities,”
said monsieur de Maubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche told me that Grand’mère found you <span class='it'>un
jeune homme très sévère</span>,” said madame Vervier, her
eyes still resting on him as if with a mild amusement.
“She is not accustomed to young men such as you. I
do not think she has ever met such a one. It is a heavy
intelligence”—she now addressed monsieur de Maubert.
“It must always, I imagine, have been a heavy
talent. One wonders where Blanche found her delicious
gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A grandfather, a father, might account for that,”
said monsieur de Maubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A father might. A grandfather has only madame
Collet to his credit,” smiled madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her talent is too sharp. Like herself,” said André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the parts she prefers need the keen edge,” said
madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every part needs a soul, and she has none; <span class='it'>elle n’a
pas d’âme</span>,” said André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier defended her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With so much intelligence she needs less soul than
other people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon, <span class='it'>chère madame</span>. With so much intelligence
one needs more. It is that one feels in her. The sheath
is too thin. The blade comes through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vous êtes méchant</span>,” said madame Vervier, and
there was in her voice none of the inciting gaiety usual
to the reproach; she spoke gravely, looking down at the
cloth and slightly moving her spoon and fork upon it,
and Giles suddenly divined that poor mademoiselle
Blanche was in love with André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais non! Mais non!</span> I think her charming,”
laughed André. “But I can understand that madame
Dumont is her grandmother.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until next day, after luncheon, that the
time came, and Giles—as madame Vervier said to
him, “I find it too hot for tennis to-day. Will you stay
behind and talk with me, monsieur Giles?”—felt
sure that it all had been planned, intended from the
first. If she had thus delayed, it was in order that he
should come to know her better and feel more at home
with her. It was also in order that she should take his
measure and see more surely what she was going to do
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert, also, was going to Allongeville;
André’s motor waited at the gate. He and
madame Vervier were to have the afternoon to themselves,
and as they all parted on the verandah, Giles
saw that Alix cast a long look at him.—Poor little
Alix! How little she could guess at what he hoped
for from this interview! If madame Vervier had her
intentions, he had his. And though he believed they
would not clash, his heart was beating quickly as he
followed her to the drawing-room. So many things,
lay between him and madame Vervier and her glance,
her voice, seemed to tell him that none of them were to
be evaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drawing-room was fresh and pale; so pale in its
citrons, whites, and dim jade-greens, that the sunlight
outside, shining against the transparent reed blinds,
looked tawny in its fierce, prowling splendour. The sea
was there, sparkling in its immensity across the lower
half of the long windows, and the sky of another blue
was across the upper half and the vines and honeysuckle
that garlanded the verandah outside hardly
stirred in the brilliant air. There were bowls of sweet-smelling
small white roses from the garden, and madame
Vervier was in white, the thin woollen dress with
the sash at her waist and tassels at her breast that left
bare her lovely arms and neck. Her russet hair was all
tossed back to-day and there was something ingenuous
in the shape of her forehead thus uncovered; something
candid and childlike. In her hand, as she sat before
Giles, she held a stone, a flat, smooth stone, pinkish-grey,
that she had perhaps picked up on the beach in
one of her walks at dawn. She held it, weighing it
slightly from time to time and from time to time putting
it against her lips or cheek, as if to enjoy its coolness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had never in his life seen anything so beautiful.
He knew that she was not beautiful if computed or examined
by standards of exactitude; that her eyes were
small, her nose a little flattened, her mouth clumsily
drawn; but power so emanated from her gaze, magic
so pervaded her lips and brows, sweetness lay with
such a bloom of light upon her, that every imperfection
was dissolved in the unity that made a sort of music in
his mind. She was like an embodiment of music—and
what was that urgent, searching rhythm, that evocation
of flowers and dew and night? The melody of
Brahms’s “Sapphische Ode” surged into his mind and
with it a deep, an almost overpowering sadness. With
the song he remembered everything; everything was
evoked. The Spring day in the Bois; Owen’s face of
love; and Toppie, far away, betrayed and forgotten,
fixed in her trance of fidelity. To see madame Vervier,
to remember Toppie, was almost to feel that he himself
was Owen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, then,” said madame Vervier. Her arm
lay along the table beside her. She looked across at him
and held the stone in her upturned palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the way she began; those the very first
words she said after she had led him in, after their long
silence, when they found themselves alone together.
The throb of André’s car had long since faded down
the lane. The house was still; and Giles felt that his
heart was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’ve known from the beginning,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix told me,” said madame Vervier. “You saw us
one day in the Bois.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she tells me that you feel him to have been
unfaithful to his betrothed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Giles repeated. He was amazed yet not
overwhelmed by her direct approach. He kept his
eyes upon her. “Unfaithful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a weight in the word that madame Vervier
would not feel, for André was now entangled with
his thought of Owen. It was hardly eighteen months
ago; and André had succeeded Owen. But all unaware,
as she might well be, of his further knowledge,
her next words answered, by implication, the charge.
If she admitted contemporaneity in love, why not succession?
“There,” she said, “you were mistaken. We
were lovers, it is true; but he knew that it was not to
last. He knew that if not death, then life must part us.
In his heart he was not unfaithful. He would have
gone back to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean with a lie?” asked Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a lie? Yes; I imagine it would have been with
a lie,” madame Vervier did not hesitate. “But the essential
would be there. He had not ceased to love
her.—It was not his fault. He was swept away,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she looked like that when she had swept Owen
away? Was it an easy, an everyday thing to her, to see
men swept away? He tried to beat down the visions
that assailed him, but again and again, on the rising
surge of the “Sapphische Ode,” they returned. Owen
sitting before her, as he now sat, in the pale, fresh,
shaded room; Owen rising suddenly to take her in his
arms.—There would be no surprise to her in that.—She
would have seen it coming. “You mean that it
was your fault, then?” Giles muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I do not mean that,” madame Vervier answered,
and as, in speaking, she weighed her stone
lightly up and down, her eyes on his, he felt that it was
his heart rather than her own guilt she weighed so in
her hand.—How often she had weighed men’s hearts!
How conversant with their trembling must she be!
“No; that is not what I meant.—He moored his boat
at the edge of a torrent. That was all. He was swept
away,” madame Vervier repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was what Alix said of you,” Giles muttered
again. He felt as if madame Vervier must see the
throbbing of his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Alix said of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you were like a mountain-torrent. She wanted
me to understand you. She thought I might be of
help to you some day. She thought of you, poor child,
as in some kind of danger; beautiful and in danger.—How
can you say it wasn’t your fault?” Giles demanded,
and, with the thought of Alix and what she
hoped from him, he felt that he struggled to keep his
footing. “If you carried him away, it was your fault.—I
believe that’s what you live for; to carry men
away,” he heard himself unbelievably uttering, and it
seemed to him, as the sombre magic of her eyes dwelt
on him that it was for Owen he was speaking, and for
all the others; since now he understood them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, after he had said these last words,
contemplated him in silence. For a long time she
said nothing, and Giles, in the silence, felt that their
confrontation was altered in its quality. When she
spoke at last, it was not in anger. It was, rather, with
a strange mildness. “I do not overflow my banks,
ever,” she said. “You must not launch your boat upon
me; that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he had found himself understanding them all—all
those others—was it possible that she saw him
merely as one of them? Was she warning him? Had
she seen his need of warning? Giles felt his face growing
hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not launch your boat upon me,” madame
Vervier repeated, observing him with grave but
faintly ironic kindliness. “If I am a torrent, if I am
dangerous, to myself and others, my nature is there as
it was given to me. I may not alter it. The blame lies
with those who are unwary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be true,” Giles muttered. “I have nothing
to do with you, of course. I don’t understand
you. But I do understand my brother. His weakness
doesn’t excuse him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are severe. You have never felt a great passion,
that is evident,” madame Vervier observed. “The
feeling he had for me was so different from the feeling
he had for Toppie that infidelity was hardly in question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly in question? Don’t you see that it shut
him away from her for ever?” Giles’s voice was
dark with grief. “Don’t you see that a man who
chooses one kind of love turns his back on the other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if he is strong enough,” madame Vervier, with
her mildness, returned. “Your brother, I think, gained
in strength from our friendship. We pay, it is true, for
most things in life. It is painful to have a secret from
the heart nearest ours; yet one need not regret one’s
secret. I believe that Owen would have been strong
enough not to regret. Strong enough”—madame
Vervier, while she dropped the quiet phrases kept her
faint smile—“not to grow to hate me because he
could not tell Toppie how much he had loved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it true? Giles wondered, sitting there before
her, his head bent down while he stared up at her from
under his brows, frowning and intent. Could Owen,
ever, have been as strong as that? And would it have
been strength? No; madame Vervier might have
armed him against remorse; but she did not know
Toppie. Toppie’s radiance would have fallen back,
dimmed, startled, from the presence of the thing hidden
yet operative in her life and Owen’s. A canker
would have eaten; bitterness and darkness would have
spread. Either her radiance would have withdrawn
from him, or, beating too strongly at his defences, it
would have discovered all. Dismay, devastation would
have broken in upon them, and if Toppie could still
have forgiven it would have been with a sick and altered
heart. But he could not talk to madame Vervier
about Toppie. The strange thing was, as he saw Toppie’s
radiance, that he felt himself safe from the torrent,
and that he began to understand madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think of yourself as very strong,” he said suddenly,
and in their long silence he could see that something
of her security left her; it was as if she felt
the approach of an unexpected adversary. “You think
you can do as you like with life. You’re not afraid of
life; and that’s rather splendid of you—if I may say
so. But it’s never occurred to you to be afraid of yourself.
And the time might come, you know, when you’d
be carried away, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carried away?” madame Vervier repeated. Her
voice was altered. She was unprepared. And in her
momentary confusion it was with haughtiness that she
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, carried away,” Giles repeated, understanding
madame Vervier more than ever and that the haughtiness
was a shield. “And if you were, you’d be helpless,
as he was; as all the others are;—and you’d find, I believe,
that you couldn’t go back quietly to the things
you’d jeopardized.—I mean, they’d have changed;
they’d have been spoiled. You made Owen suffer; I’m
sure of it. You gave him more suffering than happiness.
He lost Toppie through you, and he knew he’d lost
her. He couldn’t have lived with Toppie on a lie. The
payment may be more than our own suffering; it may
be other people’s. That’s what you don’t seem to see.—And
as for doing as you like, with yourself and other
people, it doesn’t work, the kind of life you lead. I’m
sure it doesn’t work. It will spoil you, too. More and
more you’ll be battered and bruised;—it’s horrible to
think of;—and at last wrecked. Or else so petrified
and hardened that nothing can really come to you any
more. That’s the way it would happen with anyone
like you.” Giles had looked away from her in speaking,
but now he lifted his eyes to hers again. “I feel
sure of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier sat there, her arm lying on the
table, her hand holding the stone, and looked fixedly
upon him. He had thought of nothing definite, of
nothing imminent in speaking. He had been able to
speak only because the thought of Toppie had come to
him so overmasteringly, arming him with such repudiation
of madame Vervier’s philosophy. But now,
as she sat silent for so long, he saw suddenly what the
fear was that, like a Medusa head, he had held up before
her. She was older than André de Valenbois; she
loved him passionately; and she was not sure of him.
It was in her eyes, in her silence, as she faced him, that
Giles read the fear; definite; imminent. And he was
horribly sorry for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a strange young man,” she said at last.
The haughtiness was gone. There was no resentment
in her voice. She only spoke carefully, as though she
felt her way in a world changed to ice. “How can
you think you know me well enough to say these
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know you well enough. It’s because we are
so near. Through Alix. Through my brother. You’ve
made such a difference in my life. Everything is
changed for me because of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It need not be as you say,” said madame Vervier,
and after her long pause it was as if the strength he had
called in question came creeping back into her frozen
veins. “Not as you say;—if one has wisdom. One
may suffer;—do you imagine that I have not already
suffered?—but one need not be wrecked. And I have
great wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to be wrecked.—You know
that,” Giles muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I know it. I see it. You are not an avenging
angel,” said madame Vervier, and she was able once
more to summon the faint, ironic smile. “You are
really, under all the denunciation, so full of kindness.
That is what makes you so unexpected.—So very
strange.—But do not fear for me too much. I shall
know when youth is over. I shall know when the laurels
are cut and winter has come to the woods. I shall
be able to furl my sails before the night comes on; and
if one furls one’s sails in time, monsieur Giles, one is
never wrecked. And there will be, I trust, a little harbour
for me somewhere. Alix’s children to love. And
my memories. I shall be in old age a much happier
woman than most. Most old women”—madame
Vervier smiled on, her eyes on his—“have only to remember
how they were loved by nobody at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was there to say to her? Giles, as he considered
her, felt a dim smart of tears rising to his eyes.
She had done with him as Alix had hoped she would.
He saw her as lovely; as menaced. He wished that he
could protect her. “I hope it will be with you like
that,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it will,” said madame Vervier. “You
have seen me and my life a little too logically, too
rigidly, my kind monsieur Giles. I did not choose it so.
It chose me, rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” Giles exclaimed, “that’s what I feel in you.
That’s my excuse for what I’ve said to you. Why can’t
you turn back even now? You are so much too good
for it. You’re good enough,” Giles declared, with a
sense of further illumination, “for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, again arrested, considered him.
Then, gently, sadly, with a compassionate sincerity,
she shook her head. “One never turns back at my age.
One’s path has grown too closely about one. Other
paths are all blocked out. And I was perhaps destined
for it. For some women the life of home, the still, deep
stream suffices. Children may fill their hearts and
stifle the personal longings; but for others these compensations
are not enough. They must have love.
They must have a lover. And in France husbands
are seldom lovers. So, if one is a mountain-torrent,
one leaps over the precipice. Do you see? That is my
history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s different with us,” Giles murmured. “We have
different hopes for marriage. You didn’t give yourself
time. If you turn your back on a thing, you can’t find
out its reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mountain-torrent, at twenty-three,” said
madame Vervier, “is not a philosopher. No; I did not
see what I was leaping to, but I saw plainly what I left.
And I do not say that I regret. All that I do say is that
I wish no leaps for Alix. Let us now speak of Alix. You
have done your duty by me and read me my lesson,
and it is all because you want to speak of Alix. I am
well aware that you have not come to France in order
to understand or grow fond of her mother—kind
though you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it was for you—only for you.” Giles did not
know how to put it. “Because of what I see in you.
As to Alix, you want for her what I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safety. Yes,” said madame Vervier. “The deep,
quiet stream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s that already,” said Giles. “Alix isn’t the
mountain-torrent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, we none of us know what we are till we come
to the precipice,” said madame Vervier. “But I am
glad you feel that of my Alix. I trust your reading.
I could almost believe, at moments, watching you with
her, that you understand her better than I do. There
is in Alix an austerity that sometimes disconcerts me.
Yours is a nature nearer hers than mine. I have
thought of it deeply in these last days, monsieur Giles,
and I have made up my mind. Will you marry her?”
said madame Vervier, laying down the stone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many things to consider,” madame Vervier
pursued, simply and tranquilly, while Giles sat
transfixed. “I should have to think of many things.—Your
position; your prospects; they are not, I
gather, brilliant. But one of the gravest disadvantages
of a position like mine is that it narrows my field
of choice; terribly narrows it. Family and position
count for everything here in France. It is not one little
individual choosing another little individual; we are
more serious than you in that. It is one family choosing
another. It is two <span class='it'>foyers</span> coming together to found
a third. I have spoiled all this for Alix.” Madame
Vervier took up her stone again, again weighing it in
her hand, and now it was as if she weighed the sense of
her culpability towards her child. “I have spoiled it.
Money would have helped me to atone; but not only
was I not <span class='it'>philosophe</span> at twenty-three; I was also credulous;
ignorant; reckless. The man for whom I left my
husband was poor and had great schemes. I gave him
all I had. He sucked me dry. <span class='it'>C’était un bien méchant
homme</span>,” madame Vervier remarked in a tone of surpassing
detachment, “and what would have been my
fate I cannot tell had not the admirable friend who
rescued me from his clutches left me, on dying, a small
annuity. That is all I dispose of. And with what I
have been able to set aside for Alix year by year, I have
amassed only the tiniest <span class='it'>dot</span>; hardly enough to clothe
her.—I go into all this very summarily for the
moment, though I owe you every detail. You shall
have them later on. You shall hear of the old aunts
who brought me up and who were, also, inveigled by
monsieur Vervier. Even my family did not save
me since I was so unfortunate as to marry him after
the divorce. It is a long story. But for the present it
is enough that you should see why, aside from my own
position, there is for Alix no possibility of a suitable
marriage in France. Whereas in England all is different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s different in England,” Giles muttered,
since she paused as if for his assent. He was still too
transfixed by the sudden theme to dispose of his own
thoughts. He felt as if madame Vervier, with her calm,
her deliberation, her fluency, were casting, loop by
loop, a silken net about him. And he, the dismayed
and astonished fish, looked here and there through the
meshes for a means of escape that would not too violently
tear the web.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite different,” said madame Vervier with confidence.
“That is why I sent her to England. That is
why I make you my proposal now. In blood Alix is
much your superior; your fortune, I know is small;
your position obscure. But I like you monsieur Giles;—I
like you very much. Oh, I have studied you since
you came among us! And,” madame Vervier added,
smiling with a kind of indulgence upon him, “you like
Alix very much. I have seen that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she gathered up the last strand and considered
her captive before drawing him definitely on shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And poor little Alix? Where does she come in?”
broke from Giles. After his long mute immobility these
were the first words that came to him. “Is she to be
considered in the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little Alix? Why poor?” madame Vervier
questioned kindly. “It would not with you be brilliant;
but it would be safe. You will be tender and
faithful always. You have not to assure me of that.
And you would, I am convinced, do all that is in your
power to do in order that she may be well placed in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And aren’t her feelings to count at all in this disposal
of her? She’d never have me,” Giles declared
with a sort of indignant mirth. “I’m the last person in
the world she’d ever think of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You underrate your attractions,” said madame
Vervier, still more indulgently. “Alix is very fond of
you. And she is still a child; singularly still a child.
We may for a year or two put the question of Alix’s
feelings aside. At her age one has no feelings. It lies
with you, and with me, to see that when the time comes
they are the right ones. She is devoted to you”—madame
Vervier enlarged her assurance. “That is unquestionable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I care for somebody else!” Giles heard himself
almost shouting. It was unbelievable that he should
have to say to madame Vervier what he had never
explicitly said to himself; unbelievable that he must
set the sacred figure of Toppie between them. But
she was actually drawing him on shore and there was
nothing for it but to break through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody else?” madame Vervier repeated. Giles
had grown pale with the shock of his own avowal, yet,
all the same, he was aware of a side glance at the comedy
of her discomfiture. It was as if all the strands
dropped from her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he nodded; “I love somebody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She might be discomfited, but she retained her resourcefulness.
“Somebody I know of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Giles doggedly repeated. “Somebody you
know of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then madame Vervier, after their little pause,
who supplied, with a strange softness, the evident
name.—“Toppie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Toppie.” Giles turned his head away and
fixed his eyes on the blue outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And madame Vervier sat silent. Very gently she laid
down her stone—Giles was never to forget the look
of that smooth, pinkish-grey stone—and folded her
hands in her lap. She rested her eyes upon the young
man—though his head was turned away from her
Giles knew that she was looking at him;—and the
silence, in the pale room, with the brilliant day beating
from without upon it, grew long. It grew so long that
Giles had time to draw his mind from his own confusion
and to wonder what was in hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, when she spoke, her voice was so new to him,
so unexpected, that it was as if a new chapter in his
knowledge of her opened gently before his eyes. Uncertainty,
hesitation was in it; something almost shy;
a lovely sweetness. It was revealed to him that for all
her goddess-like invulnerability she might have known
a qualm of pity for Toppie; it was revealed to him that
a romantic girl still lived in her heart, rapt in the wonder
of a love-story. “But then—does not that make
it all right?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean, right?” Giles asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you love Toppie?—Will you not marry her?
Will you not both be happy?—In your beautiful
English way of happiness—for ever after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was smiling at him from her cloud of shyness,
seeming to feel the secret disclosed to her too beautiful
and delicate for her to venture near its nest; and the
childlike quality he had seen in her forehead irradiated
all her features, while in sincerest, most ingenuous joy
she forgot her own hopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” said Giles—and he spoke gently to that
child—“Toppie would never have me. She’ll never
love anyone but Owen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owen’s name did not for a moment stay her. “Never?
Oh, no. You are young enough to believe in that word;
and so is she. I am old and wise in that. You may
trust me when I tell you that it is a word too large for
our slight human nature. So many eternities”—madame
Vervier smiled at him—“I have seen melt away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d never have me,” Giles repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think that no one will have you. It is not so.—Have
you tried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Giles shook his head. “I don’t think I want
to try, really—I don’t think I want her different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dieu!</span>” madame Vervier now breathed. “You will
embrace a celibate life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Perhaps I shall. I never thought
about it,” poor Giles muttered. “I’ve never thought
about Toppie in that way. I’ve always loved her—ever
since I was a boy—knowing that she could only
be for somebody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then”—madame Vervier in a slight bewilderment
groped her way among these unfamiliar shapes—“if
you have never thought about her in that way—perhaps
you will be able to think about Alix. She,
too, cares so much for your Toppie. Toppie would become
your patron-saint. Together you would worship
at her shrine.—Does it interfere with what I had
planned for you and Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it does. I’m afraid it absolutely interferes.”
Giles, his face suffused with red, sat looking
down, struggling with difficulty to master a sense of
tears. “It’s impossible, you know; quite impossible.
Dear little Alix. All I ask, you must see that, is to take
care of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have blundered,” said madame Vervier. “Forgive
me. We will speak of it no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve spoken of it beautifully. I’m glad to
have you know,” said Giles, and the strange sense that
this was so made part of his amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will speak quite differently, then, of Alix,”
said madame Vervier. “We will talk of her, not as
your future wife, but as your little friend. Even so she
is fortunate. And I!—how fortunate I am—for I
know that I can count upon you absolutely. You will
help me as no one else can help me. If not you, then
another English husband. Who is this Lady Mary of
whom Alix has written to me? She has sons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like being borne on the wings of a great aeroplane
from continent to continent;—one nearly as
strange as the other. Giles really felt inclined to gasp
and ask for mercy. He could not go so fast or rise
so far without a sense of giddiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Mary Hamble? Sons? I’m sure I don’t
know,” he said, staring at the pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not know her? You have no <span class='it'>relations</span> with
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen her only once in my life. Alix, as far as
I remember, has seen her only once. Last winter. She’s
a nice woman. That’s all I know about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It was last winter. But she asked Alix to go
to them. It was very foolish of her not to have gone.
If I had been there it would not have happened so.
Alix wrote of her with much liking. I gathered from
the impression Alix had of her that it would be a good
<span class='it'>milieu</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, excellent I should say. Much better than ours,
of course.” Giles was able to recover something of his
own broad smile, the farce of it, to his seeing, breaking
through too strongly. “You’re quite right about us.
We’re not brilliant at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I had inferred.” Madame Vervier considered
him with kind and lucid eyes. “She is a <span class='it'>femme du
monde</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much so, I imagine. I don’t know any <span class='it'>femmes
du monde</span>, except you,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my claim to the rôle would be disputed,” madame
Vervier remarked. “She will, I think, have sons.
Since it is a position, there will be a son to inherit it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes. There certainly might be,” said the
laughing Giles. He leaned back, clasping his ankle with
his hands, and took open possession of his mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, all indulgence, showed her awareness
of its grounds. “It is strange to you, almost horrifying,
that I should have such computations; is it
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know. Plenty of English mothers
have them, of course. Only they’re not so frank about
them. All the same, you know, you mustn’t count upon
us. We couldn’t do much in that line. My mother, for
instance, would never think of such a thing, and if
Alix came back to us she’d be like one of my sisters;
trained, if you like, to a profession. Marriage would
only be by chance; for her, as for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dieu!</span> You are a strange people!” said madame
Vervier. “To leave to chance what is of the most vital
importance in a woman’s life! No; you are not serious.
You live <span class='it'>dans le brouillard</span>. Life must be less difficult
a thing with you since it is possible to face it so lightly.
I should not, it is evident, care to leave Alix among you
unless it were in the hope of marriage. I could myself
have her trained to a profession. If I gave her up again,
it would be because I hoped for something better. I
am not <span class='it'>féministe</span>. I think a professional life deplorable
for a woman. A necessity in many cases, no doubt; but
a deplorable necessity. An artist’s life is happier; but I
hope that my Alix may find the happiest life; the life
of a woman married well. So, if she returns to England,
it is for the sake of the chances, and you, I believe, will
help to make them for her. To begin with, you will see
that she accepts Lady Mary Hamble’s next invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound her impudence!” Giles was saying to
himself, but he was saying it tenderly. He was enjoying
her impudence; it was part of the comedy that, for
all her pitiful, her tragic aspects, she offered him. “I
see that I am to be counted upon as a sort of <span class='it'>père de
famille</span> for Alix,” he observed, and though genial his
tone was certainly ironic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Précisément</span>,” smiled madame Vervier. “You will
not, I know, be a dog in the manger and grudge to
others what you do not want for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but that’s a very different thing from asking
Old Dog Tray to go trotting about to find her a husband,”
Giles objected. “I don’t see myself as a matchmaker,
you know; I can’t promise to do anything at
all in that line for Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were not asked to be Old Dog Tray. You
were asked to be <span class='it'>le Prince Charmant</span>,” madame Vervier
returned, a hint of the caustic in her kindness.
“And I do not now ask you to trot. I ask you only, if
an occasion offers, to see that she does not miss it. She
has not the heredity of the English girl. She will not
know how to make, or take, occasions for herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are being rather nasty about the English
girl,” Giles now commented. He and madame
Vervier were on strangely intimate terms and could
deal out friendly irony to one another. “The English
young man counts for something after all. What we
hope for, we romantic English, is that he will make the
occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. Not nasty; not at all nasty. I admire
them, your English girls; I admire their enterprise,”
smiled madame Vervier. “Young men do not know
how to make occasions, and since the English mother
feels it beneath her dignity to make them, it is left for
the girl to combine the rôle of mother and daughter. It
is a difference of <span class='it'>mœurs</span>, that is all, and I wish Alix to
have the advantage of your <span class='it'>mœurs</span> while keeping the
immunities of her own. The question that now remains
is: Does she return to you? She does not expect
to. You will have gathered that she feels very keenly
your brother’s silence in regard to his visits to us in
Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again it was a case of her surpassing detachment.
She went to the heart of the matter as if it had been,
merely, a question of his brother. Yet the strange
thing was that, though so detached, she did not affect
one as callous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She feels it very keenly,” said Giles. “She
can’t, of course, understand the grounds of his shrinking.
She was sure that when you knew you would feel
as she did and would not think of letting her come
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For madame Vervier had not known. He was sure of
that now. She might be detached, and even callous;
but she was not brazen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>La pauvre chérie!</span>” the mother ejaculated and it
was on a sudden note of profound tenderness. “She
is sensitive to such a point, and it is obvious that, had I
imagined such a predicament for her, I could not have
sent her among you. We must not blame him. He
could not have foreseen what was to come.” She mused
now, compassionately, upon the grounds of Owen’s
shrinking. “But how much wiser had he written quite
openly and naturally of his leaves to Paris. The tone
should have been kept to the tone of Cannes. Ah, it is
indeed a pity that he showed so little resource!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose Owen was in a state of mind to feel
resourceful,” said Giles sombrely. When madame Vervier
spoke like this, chasms opened between them. But
were there not just such chasms between him and
Alix? “I think I like him the better for it,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—and I do not love him the less!” madame
Vervier returned with an effect of quickness, though
she spoke quietly. “I do not love him the less. I do not
even blame him. And it is this leniency of mine that
has given Alix her first perplexity in regard to my conduct.—Or
is it her first? Who knows what goes on in
those innocent but astute young hearts!—Ah, monsieur
Giles, that, you would like to tell me, will be the
worst punishment of all;—when Alix knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to be punished,” said Giles sombrely.
“I don’t want to tell you anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so sure to come that it needs no telling. That
is perhaps what is in your mind.—Or, no; it is only
that you are kind, strangely kind to me,” said madame
Vervier, rising as she spoke and moving, with her light,
majestic step to the window. She pulled up the blind,
for the sun no longer beat into the room, and stood
looking out for a moment without speaking, her back
turned to him; then she said: “Alix, too, is kind. I do
not fear for our relation, hers and mine. When she is of
an age to hear the truth, she shall hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves you very deeply,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves me very deeply,” madame Vervier repeated.
“I have no fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, too, had risen, and moved to the mantelpiece
where the picture of Alix in its blue-and-silver frame
stood. He looked at it in silence for some moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how will you persuade her to come back?” he
said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want her back?” madame Vervier asked from
the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I want her back,” said Giles. He spoke
quietly, almost casually; yet it was strange to feel the
weight of his own decision. He pledged himself to
something with his words. They implicated him in the
situation from which he removed Alix. It was only for
himself that he had a right to speak and in accepting
Alix he accepted the cloud that hung about her; he
brought it back among them; and he knew that the
responsibility was heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she shall go to you,” said madame Vervier.
“I shall not be able to persuade her. I shall attempt no
persuasion. She will obey me. That is all. She will
wonder at me for sending her. She will feel that it
should too much offend my pride to send her back on
false pretences”—how they understood each other,
mother and child—“but she will go. Our French
children learn to obey. It is the first article in their
creed.—And since the pretences are not too false for
your taste, monsieur Giles, they are not too false for
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are too false for my taste,” said Giles. He
was implicated, but madame Vervier must see just how
and where. “It’s Alix I’m thinking of. I sacrifice my
taste to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said madame Vervier, “sacrifice my
pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood there looking out, white against the blue,
and her voice, for all its calm, was sombre. “I am not
ungrateful,” she added. “Do not think me ungrateful.
I see what you do for my child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what <span class='it'>you</span> do for her,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes;—but I am a mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be all the harder,” said Giles. “You consent
to see yourself belittled in her eyes. And you consent
to live without her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier stood silent at that for a long moment.
Something of the grave ardour in the young
Englishman’s voice may well have touched her to a
deeper vision of herself, and of him. It was as if arrested
that she stood contemplating the novel homage
laid at her feet. For, after her pause, she turned suddenly,
and fixed her dark gaze upon him. He was never
to forget her as she stood there, against the great sea
and sky; never to forget, as the last of all the varying
impressions of the afternoon, his sense of a greatness,
a magnanimity, like the sky’s, arching above her
earthly errors. It remained with him even though the
last words she spoke were so sad, as if, instead of the
splendour he divined in her, she held out to him a handful
of dust. “Do not think too well of me,” she said.
“I like you too much. With you there can be no
pretence. Do not think too well. It is best for Alix;
but it is best for me, too, that she should not be near
my life.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The tennis-players returned at tea-time, bringing monsieur
Claussel with them. He was a young man with
shy, soft, prominent dark eyes and the smallest dot of
a dark moustache on either side of a nervous upper lip,
and, when tennis was not in progress to absorb his attention,
it was excessively directed to the social exigencies
of the occasion. Giles imagined, as he watched him
spring from his chair to offer it, stand back to let a lady
pass, bow with heels together, and tentatively resume
his seat only again to leave it, that he was perhaps less
at home in the jungle than André, and felt, in his introduction
to it, a doubled need for every amenity. It was
his first appearance at the Chardonnerets tea-table,
and in his presence, the presence of mademoiselle Fontaine,
her mother and grandmother, madame Vervier
may have felt a convenience. If she found it at all
difficult to face Alix and André and Giles after the
interview from which she had just come, her guests,
and monsieur Claussel in particular, gave her an excuse
for looking at them rather than at her intimates.
And Giles felt sure that she avoided her daughter’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were on her, those remote blue eyes of Alix’s,
with no insistence, no appeal. They dwelt in a wide
contemplativeness that recalled to him madame Vervier’s
own, were it not that proud patience rather than
security lay behind it; and Giles had the fancy, as he
looked at her, that, in the gaze of Alix, the Mouverays,
beneath the threshold of the child’s consciousness,
were judging Hélène Vervier. Whatever the verdict,
Alix’s tenderness for her mother would not waver; but
he watched the Mouverays imparting to her need a
further reënforcement of pride and courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tea was prolonged. Madame Dumont, in a great
crested bonnet, sat enthroned, receiving cakes and
homage. She was rather silent, rather, in her black
draperies, the sunken old raven, its feathers ruffled
high. Yet Giles caught more than once the piercing
glint of an avid eye, turning in conjectures that he
could too well imagine upon madame Vervier and
André; upon himself and Alix; and once, in the glance
of mademoiselle Blanche, he seemed to see a stealthy
hereditary surmise, and Alix rather than madame
Vervier was its object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Jules was persuaded to bring out his canvases
and range them for monsieur Claussel’s admiration.
The painful, vivid patterns and colours still distressed
Giles, but, his eyes already acclimatized to
their strangeness, began to exercise a charm. “<span class='it'>Quel
horreur!</span>” madame Dumont cried, but was fondly
checked by mademoiselle Blanche, who murmured to
her, smiling over her head at Giles: “We are no longer
in the days of Bouguereau and Meissonnier, Grand’mère!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She confided to him, as they stood side by side, that
monsieur Claussel was a devout admirer of modern art
and that his admiration, since he was the heir to a
<span class='it'>fortune princière—faite dans les pâtes</span>—might be of
much significance to poor Jules. “She arranged it all,
you may be sure,” said mademoiselle Blanche, casting
a fond glance upon their hostess. “It is always she who
thinks of such opportunities for her friends.—What
a heart, what a mind it is!—Whatever her own perplexities
and anxieties—and I can assure you that her
life does not lack them—she never fails in resource
and kindness when it is a question of her friends’ interests.—She
is looking pale—very weary, is it not
so?—You take mademoiselle Alix back to England
with you?” And since Giles, disconcerted, remained
silent, mademoiselle Blanche added: “She is ready always
to sacrifice herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais oui, c’est très bizarre</span>,” little madame Collet
murmured, craning her neck to see the pictures, while
Giles wondered over mademoiselle Blanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>André, meanwhile, smiling in a happy confidence,
pointed out planes and stresses to the heir of <span class='it'>les pâtes</span>,
who stood with his little shoulders screwed up, his elbows
in his hands, rapt away from shyness and self-consciousness
by his sincere delight. Monsieur Jules
remained morose; but it was evident that he had found
a munificent patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when they were all gone and an evening of
dusky rose began, after the hot day, to drop softly
from the sky, madame Vervier said to André that
she must take the air. She would go with him for
a little turn in his car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not yet ready for a meeting with her child.
If she was to think things over and decide how she
should put them to Alix, she must get away to do it.
Giles understood; but how could Alix understand such
necessities? He guessed at the grief and perplexity
that must strive within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, indefatigable as you are, <span class='it'>ma chère enfant</span>,”
said monsieur de Maubert when he and Giles
and Alix were left alone, “framed of steel and india-rubber
as I sometimes feel you to be when I watch
your day, you will doubtless wish to go for a walk with
monsieur Giles. Do not hesitate to leave me. I shall,
I think, have a siesta here with my head in the shade
and my feet in the sunset; even in the details of life,
monsieur Giles, I am, you see, the Epicurean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles knew, then, that madame Vervier’s intentions,
in regard to himself and Alix, had been imparted to
monsieur de Maubert who thus took occasion for furthering
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alix said: “No; the walk is not to be with Giles.
I have promised Annette Laboulie to catch shrimps
with her on the beach till supper-time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who,” monsieur de Maubert, kindly, yet with
a certain austerity inquired, “is Annette Laboulie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came with my shoes her father had mended,
the other afternoon. Do you remember? A dark, thin
girl. She has not enough to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the sad young ragamuffin with the untidy
hair? Not enough to eat? That must be seen to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a ragamuffin; and untidy; I reproach her for
that. But she is clean. And she is a clever girl in all
sorts of ways. There are eight children, and Annette
is a mother to them all. We are great friends. I used
to play with her when I was little and Maman and I
first came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Giles, you are not flattered by this preference!”
smiled monsieur de Maubert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they don’t even invite me to join them!”
laughed Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he understood. After the longing to know what
Maman had said to Giles must come the longing to
know what Giles now felt about Maman; but Alix
wanted none of his impressions until those of Maman
had been vouchsafed to her. As if by some deep instinct
she knew that her destiny had been in question
that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do come with us, Giles,” she now said, and he
replied that he really had letters he ought to write.
“Letters home. You see my time here is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up? Indeed? Why up?” monsieur de Maubert inquired
very kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve stayed already longer than I intended
and they all expect me back in time to start next Monday
on a walking tour around the coast of Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next Monday? But that means that you will leave
us the day after to-morrow. You will miss our Sunday
excursion to Caudebec.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was looking at him; wondering, he knew,
whether his resolve was sudden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had written his letter to his mother, he
went out into the village to post it, and coming back
by the cliff he was able to see that even if Annette had
been an improvisation the drama of the shrimping was
being carried out. The two girls were pushing their
nets before them on the sands, bare-legged, in the shallow
water. Their voices, bell-like, came to him through
the evening air. Alix laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her faculty for fraternizing with the people seemed
to him a charming gift. Neither Ruth nor Rosemary
would have known what to do with Annette in tête-à-tête.
They could have dealt with her coöperatively; in
the Girl Guides or one of Aunt Bella’s clubs; but not
as an individual. And Toppie, full of still solicitude,
would have dealt with her as a soul. The difference
was that Alix was not dealing with her at all. She was
enjoying Annette as much as Annette was enjoying
her. They were simply two girls engaged in a pastime
delightful to them both; and Giles surmised that such
easy intercourse was perhaps only possible in a country
where caste was a thing so impassable that intimacy
lent itself to no misinterpretation. Caste in France,
he was coming more and more to see, centred itself on
the question of marriage. In a country where the romance
of the <span class='it'>mésalliance</span>, so dear to English hearts,
was nearly unknown, there was little likelihood of
its disintegration. How little do those know France,
thought Giles, who imagine her republican at heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier did not return from her drive till
supper time, and after supper, during which she talked
cheerfully, if with a certain languor, she established
herself in the drawing-room with monsieur de Maubert.
There was no moon to-night and the light
streamed out over the verandah from the drawing-room
window. Giles, from his place on the steps,
could see that madame Vervier, beside the lamp, had
her embroidery and that she spoke to monsieur de
Maubert in low tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix brought out a saucer of milk for a stray kitten
that she and Annette had found. “I shall take it to
Paris with me,” she said, stroking the back of the little
creature, while it drank, half choked with purrs and
lapping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not a pretty kitten, mademoiselle Alix,” said
André, who sat beside Giles smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it is not pretty; except as all kittens are pretty—the
delicate little paws; the beautiful movements.
In time it will look better; with brushing and good
food,” said Alix. “And it has a charming little coral
nose to match the coral beads under its feet.—Only
hear it purr, Giles! Have you ever noticed the softness
of a kitten’s feet?—they are like raspberries to
hold in one’s hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>André watched her meditatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is time for your bed, <span class='it'>mon enfant</span>.” Madame
Vervier’s voice came from the drawing-room. “I will
visit you before you sleep.—Ah, <span class='it'>mais non</span>! You must
not have the kitten with you. You would be devoured
by fleas. It will be quite happy shut into the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is so young, Maman; so lonely. It must so
miss its mother.” Alix stood supplicating, the kitten
held to her cheek. “I do not mind the fleas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier was melted; or it was, perhaps, an
evening on which she was inclined to indulgence.
“Very well. If you do not mind the fleas! While it
misses its mother, then. Too soon, alas, it will be a
mother itself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; for it is a male cat, Maman,” said Alix with
austere realism. “You need fear nothing on that
score. There will be no more kittens to trouble you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A la bonne heure!</span>” laughed madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she returns to you, after her holiday with us
here, the charming young creature,” André, when Alix
had carried away her kitten, observed to Giles. It was
remarkable, the sense they all gave Giles, that Alix was
permanently his responsibility, and André’s voice had
almost the geniality of family affection. If not he,
then another English husband. Alix’s future had been,
by those most concerned with it—by himself and by
her mother—definitely agreed upon; that was the
fact to which André’s voice and smile bore witness;
and madame Vervier was certainly imparting the
same news to monsieur de Maubert as she now sat embroidering
beside him in her Ingres dress and scarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix herself, meanwhile, remained in ignorance of
her destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather a shame she shouldn’t know it yet,” said
Giles. “She thinks she’s going back to Paris, you
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame? Oh, no,” said André in gentle surprise.
“It is much better that she should have her holiday
unspoiled. We are to say nothing of it to her—as madame
Vervier will tell you.—It would grieve her too
much to hear it now. By degrees, as the time draws
near, her mother will prepare her mind and bring her
to see the wisdom of the decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, of course, would be André’s point of view. He
took it for granted that <span class='it'>jeunes filles</span> should be kept in
ignorance of their destiny until such time as their elders
thought fit to enlighten them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was aware of a confused anger that seemed to
involve himself as well as André and madame Vervier.
“Since she and her mother are so devoted, it’s a pity,
I think, to hoodwink her,” he said. “I hope her mother
will tell her what she’s decided on at once. I shall advise
her to tell her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point, suddenly, a voice dropped to them
through the darkness. “I am sorry. My room is above
you. I can hear all that you say.” Alix’s voice. Thrilling
with bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young men sat mute, eyeing each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dieu! Quelle gaffe ai-je commise!</span>” whispered
André, and—“How much has she heard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As little as she could, you may be sure,” Giles
muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>André found his resource. “<span class='it'>Très bien! Très bien</span>,
mademoiselle Alix,” he called. “But this is a case
where <span class='it'>une écouteuse</span> would hear only good of herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix made no reply. The windows of her room,
Giles now remembered, opened beside his, on the roof
of the verandah. She must have heard all if she had
stood near them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is very unfortunate,” André murmured. “I
have been stupid; very stupid. I must at once make
my confession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’d better,” said Giles grimly. “It wouldn’t
do for her mother to go up now and pretend she’d
made no plans at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—our hostess would be able to meet even that
contingency,” said André with, perhaps, the slightest
flavour of irony. “A daughter, with us, knows too well
that she may trust her mother to do the best for her
happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as Giles remained sitting on, hearing in the
drawing-room the low murmur of consultation and
André’s repeated “<span class='it'>Je suis désolé</span>,” it became disastrously
clear to him that, more than Maman’s intended
accommodations of the truth, Alix would resent
André’s admission to Maman’s confidence. How, indeed,
could she interpret that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murmur in the drawing-room ceased, madame
Vervier rose and went upstairs, and, before André
could rejoin him, Giles had taken refuge in his own
room. He could not face André; he could not face
monsieur de Maubert, or madame Vervier herself,
again that evening. None of them, not even madame
Vervier, could see as he saw the disaster that had befallen
his poor little friend. He leaned at his window
feeling hot and sick, but even here, though the windows
of Alix’s room had been closed, the voices of
mother and daughter came to him through the flimsy
barrier of the wall. He could not hear the words, but
in their sharp passionate rhythm he discerned what the
words must be. “Why to him, Maman! What are
his rights! He was a stranger to us when I left you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But madame Vervier would, indeed, never lack resource.
Unready as she must feel herself to face this
further predicament, Giles heard the muffled murmur
of her voice, rising, falling, expostulating; urgent,
tender, invulnerable. She would find answers to everything.
Or was it that there were some questions her
child would not ask of her? When, at last, she ceased,
there was no reply. He heard that Alix was crying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, his last at Les Chardonnerets, dawned
high, blue, beautiful, and looking out at sunrise Giles
saw his wonderful hostess, as he had seen her on his
first morning, walking back to the house across the
grassy cliffs, wrapped in her bathing-robe. She came
slowly. Her tread had not the buoyancy of the first
day. Her head was bent; she meditated gravely. But
she made him think of a goddess who had sought inspiration
and sustainment from immersion in her own
elements of sunlight and sea-water. Power breathed
from her as she moved, and Giles, looking out at her,
was filled with a deep yet beautiful sadness. It was
like looking at a goddess. Madame Vervier seemed
separated from him by thousands of years. She might
have been a figure of myth and legend walking there,
the outlines of her ruffled hair all haloed by the sunlight,
her white arm crossed upon her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When breakfast brought them all again face to face,
Giles marvelled at Alix. If madame Vervier was ready,
she was not less so. Pale, with darkened eyelids, there
were certain appearances that she need not be expected
to keep up. Monsieur de Maubert and André de
Valenbois would understand that it had been a shock
to her to learn that her mother was again to send her
from her. But beyond the evidences of this shock they
were to see nothing. Of the greater shock she had received,
not a shadow showed itself in her glance or
voice. She was grave and quiet only; she showed the
calm resignation of the <span class='it'>jeune fille sérieuse</span> who bows to
the decisions of her elders. She smiled at her mother;
she held her kitten to lap milk. And Giles was sorry
for his invulnerable goddess, for, if it was hard that she
should have to shoulder the burden of André under
Alix’s eyes, when she already had more than enough to
carry in Owen, it must be for her the bitterest of alleviations
that Alix should do all in her power to make
the burden light. Madame Vervier must feel, as he
felt, that such resource, such understanding in Alix
could only rise from the child’s intuition of how sharp
was her mother’s need. She stood beside her mother.
She helped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maman is going to take charge of my kitten while
I am away,” she said calmly to André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Alix could help her mother, Giles could help her.
This was an opportunity. “But why shouldn’t you
bring your kitten to England, Alix?” he said. “There’s
no quarantine for cats. You could carry it easily in a
basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the quick, upward glance that Alix cast at him
above the kitten’s lapping head, he saw that its fate,
in spite of Maman’s assurances, had indeed preoccupied
her. “Oh, may I, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you may. <span class='it'>Rather!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother will not mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you imagine Mummy minding another animal
at Heathside? Why, she’s lived and breathed and had
her being, always, in a swarm of dogs, cats, and guinea-pigs.
You don’t forget, I’m sure, those white rats all
over the place last winter. She never said a word even
when she found them in her bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember. Yes. She is so kind. I should be very
glad to have my kitten.” Alix stroked the kitten’s
back. She looked down at it, and for a moment Giles
was afraid that she might be on the verge of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if mademoiselle Alix will permit me,” said
André, wishing to do his bit, but, for once, blundering
sadly, “I will present her, in place of this very ugly
little cat, with the most beautiful <span class='it'>chat</span> Angora that can
be found in Paris. A superb white Angora, mademoiselle
Alix; with blue eyes like those of a saint in a
missal.—<span class='it'>Cela vous sourit?</span>” André’s own eyes were as
blue and as bright as those of any saint in any missal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, thank you,” said Alix. “This ugly little
cat is the only one I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles wondered, as the day went on, whether Alix
was going to let him see nothing more than she showed
the others. There must be for her a sense of bitter
humiliation in Maman’s failure to fulfill her proud assurances.
And it would be like Alix to keep silent if she
were humiliated. But how near him she felt herself to
be was shown to him when, after tea, following the
others along the cliff-path, she said: “So I am to go
back to you, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ignored the morning interlude. She dismissed it
as the piece of acting it had been. She faced the whole
subject for the first time, with him, her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. So your mother told me. I hope you’re not
too sorry; for I’m so awfully glad,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Vervier, with monsieur de Maubert beside
her, and André de Valenbois with mademoiselle Fontaine,
went on before them. They were taking Giles,
on his last evening, to see a little château that lay in
its woods near the coast, in the opposite direction
from Allongeville. Giles knew that madame Vervier
had arranged that he and Alix should go together
and that she trusted him to uphold her cause as best
he could. “It was what I wanted, you know,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix, as she heard him, fixed her eyes upon her
mother’s form, rounding a green projection of the path,
her white sunshade upon her shoulder. “It was most
of all what Maman wanted, was it not, Giles?” she observed,
with a faint, curious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Giles. “You know how much I
wanted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will hardly make me believe,” said Alix, her
lips keeping their smile, “that it was you who persuaded
Maman rather than she you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no question of persuasion. How could
there have been? When we were both agreed from the
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could understand what it was that made
you agree so strongly,” said Alix after a slight silence.
“Maman says that it is for my good to finish my
studies in England, among such friends. That does not
seem to me a sufficient reason. I could finish my
studies in my own country; and I have good friends
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks, and so do I,” said Giles, “that we are
the best friends you have. Isn’t that a sufficient reason?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me a reason for not taking advantage
of such friends,” said Alix, startling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is what good friends ask,” he said. “To
be taken advantage of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak for yourself, Giles. There are others besides
you. You have no right to speak for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had his back against the wall, and Giles knew it.
The worst of it was that she knew it, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can answer for them. I told you I could. I told
you that Toppie was so fond of you that she’d feel as I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this, after a moment’s silence, Alix only said in a
voice suddenly grown sombre, “I do not blame you,
Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you don’t blame your mother,” said
Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There before them went madame Vervier, her white,
heelless feet hardly seeming, in their beautiful tread, to
touch the grass she passed over. They had no glimpse
of her face. She left them in their privacy, feeling so
secure that their privacy, since it was in his hands,
could only be for her benefit. How deeply madame
Vervier had read his heart yesterday! How clearly she
had seen that all that he asked was to show her beauty
to her child and to help her, always, in hiding from
Alix the pitiful handful of dust that, in her truth to him,
she had displayed! “I hope you don’t blame her,” he
repeated, for Alix had made no reply, and, glancing
at her now, and seeing her eyes bent down, he guessed
that at his question they had filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be strange, wouldn’t it, Alix,” he said
gently, “if it were I who had to defend your mother to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very strange, Giles,” said Alix in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all for love of you,” said Giles; and in spite of
the handful of dust he knew that this was the fundamental
truth about madame Vervier—“because of
what she thinks best for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But may one never be a judge of that oneself?”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you are a young French girl; no; you may
not,” said Giles, after a moment’s reflection. “Isn’t
that just the great difference between you and us? We
think for ourselves; but you, if you are a girl, may only
think for yourself when you are married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like England better in that,” said Alix. “One
should have a voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps your mother feels that you’ll learn to have
a right to a voice by being in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think so,” said Alix. “I do not think she
believes in having a voice. That is another great difference.
You believe that one learns to have a voice by
being given freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t be free here, Alix; I see that for myself,”
Giles said, looking at her and wondering how far her
thought could follow. Already in such unexpected
places it ran ahead of his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her eyes to his. “You mean it is not safe,
in France, for a girl to be free?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not. Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is our danger? Can you tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles found an answer that he had only recently
seen for himself: “The danger of growing up; in the
wrong way; and too soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Maman thinks that I run that danger by remaining
with her? Why am I, then, different from
other French girls whose mothers keep them with
them? Why is she different from other French
mothers? You need not tell me that she loves me. I
see how it breaks her heart.” Alix’s voice trembled
suddenly. “It breaks her heart to have to send me
away. And why should it be so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mastered the tears that had risen while she
spoke, and her eyes held his. It was the strangest
thing in his experience of Alix to feel himself seeking
the right word in which to justify her mother to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has special difficulties,” he said slowly. “You
see some of them already. You remember what you
said to me long ago about her beauty and bravery, and
her danger. It was all true. I’ve seen it now myself.
And you wanted me to help her. You felt sure that
if I knew her I’d want to help her. Well, I do. You
must trust us both. For what I have to tell you now
is that I can best help her by showing you how you
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s eyes, widened by the unshed tears, gazed at
him. “I help her by not being with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, by not being another difficulty, and the
greatest of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for how long must I be removed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until you are old enough to be free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until I marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marry, or get the freedom of the English girl; the
right to choose whether you’ll marry or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can I marry if I am in England. Is it
to have me marry there that Maman removes me?
Because,” said Alix—and her voice, tearless now,
dropped to an iron note—“that will never be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor madame Vervier and her hopes! Giles continued
to play her hand as best he could. “You
wouldn’t be made to marry in England against your
will. You might meet someone you cared for enough.
How can you tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cared for enough! To leave Maman! To leave
France!” Alix held her head high and stared before
her, facing this confirmation of her fears. And suddenly,
her last words echoing too unbearably in her
heart, he saw her lips tremble; part; and the tears, at
last, helplessly ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—my dear little Alix—don’t grieve like that,”
Giles implored. “Of course you won’t leave them;—unless
you come to feel that you care so much for
someone that you can.—And it would never be
really to leave. And while you’re over there, can’t we
count a little for you? Can’t I count? You know how
much I care for you. I’ll do my best to make you
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix shook her head. “It is not that,” she uttered
brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, then? You shan’t be married against
your will.” Giles tried to smile at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that,” Alix repeated. “Already you are
too good to me. You are unbelievably good to me.—It
is Maman.” Alix put her hand up to her eyes and
hid her tears from him as she walked. “It is Maman.—How
can she bear to let me go?—How can I bear
to be parted from her; far away; hardly seeing her;
until I am old?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she is coming back. I am so glad. I was afraid,
from things she said, once or twice, about herself, about
her life in France with her mother, that she might not
be coming,” said Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Giles sat up on the ridge where the junipers
grew. The pine-woods were behind them; below were
the birches in their autumnal dress of bronze and gold;
and brooding over all a sky of dusty rose. It was the
evening of the hottest September day and the breeze
hardly stirred the spices of the pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was only just back from his Cornish trip and
Toppie and her father had been in Bournemouth when
he had returned from France, so that this was their
first meeting. Mr. Westmacott was not well and the
sea had done him no good. Toppie was worn with
nursing him. Giles had never seen her look so white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From something deep and watchful in her eyes the
feeling came to him that her father was even more ill
than they had guessed and that she was schooling herself
to the thought of losing him. With her father gone,
Toppie’s last close link with earth would be severed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had not spoken of herself or of her anxieties
this afternoon. They had climbed the hill slowly,
stopping to look back at the sky, and Toppie had
found this favourite spot among the junipers and had
sunk down, taking off her Panama hat, battered like a
boy’s, and holding it with both hands clasped around
her knees as she sat in the deep heather. She wore her
usual grey, again an almost boyish formula; the thin
silk jumper rolled back from the throat, the thin
pleated skirt falling to her ankle. Her pale hair was
ruffled up over the black silk ribbon that bound it.
As she sat there while he lay beside her on his arm,
Giles had never felt Toppie so near him. It was more
sad than sweet to feel her so. It gave him the feeling
he would have had if she were going away on a long
journey and could be so near because she was to be so
far. And she talked to him of his time in France and
of Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She’s coming back all right,” Giles said. “I
am glad you are glad; for I am. It’s as if the child belonged
to us, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite strange, Giles, how much I feel that,”
said Toppie, turning her eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were such lovely eyes, those of Toppie’s. Giles
had always felt them, since he had first, a boy of fifteen,
seen her, the loveliest eyes in the world. Not large;
not vividly marked; her brows and lashes only a shade
darker than her hair; they conveyed the impression of
light rather than colour and of radiance rather than of
warmth. It was as if they looked at you from the
zenith on a cloudless, cold Spring day. And the words
that had always gone with them, in Giles’s mind, from
the time that he had first seen Toppie, in church, in
Advent, with pale, wintry sunlight streaming in over
her, had been: “Dayspring from on high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had stood there, in the Rectory pew, all alone,
tall and slender in her grey, with a little high tight
fur collar up to her chin and a little round fur cap
coming over her golden hair and down to her ears, and
she had, while the Psalms were being sung, turned her
eyes on the Bradley family in the pew across the nave;
looking at Owen; at Owen first—Giles felt it even
then; Owen, his nut-brown head held high while he
happily chanted out the responses in his sweet, accurate
tenor. And then her eyes had met Giles’s solemn
gaze. And those had been the words that had come
to him; full of the Christmas beauty; full almost to
tears, for the boy standing there, of radiant promise
and of heavenly love.—“Whereby the dayspring
from on high hath visited us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had seen her first. So he had always thought of
Toppie’s eyes. They showered light and loveliness
upon you; and it came from far away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite strange,” she was saying now, thinking of
him because she was thinking of Alix, just as she had
always, in the past, thought of him because she was
thinking of Owen. “From the first moment I saw her I
felt that she belonged. Perhaps it was because of what
Owen had written. He was so fond of her. She was
the dearest little girl he had ever seen. Even then I used
to think that some day, if the war left us to each other,
we would have Alix come and stay with us often. And
then the moment I saw her I felt that I loved her.—Giles,
you were very bad about letters while you were
in France. Never one to me; and hardly anything to
your mother about madame Vervier. Only that she
was charming and had a charming house. You told us
more about monsieur de Maubert—was that the
name?—and the young man who ought to have worn
a ruff and fought with Henry of Navarre. I liked so
much what you said about him. I felt as if he ought to
have known Owen. As if they would have been friends.
But of course what we most wanted to hear was about
Alix’s mother. Tell me everything now; everything
you thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything. Well, that’s rather difficult, you
know.” Giles turned over on his elbow and looked
down at the heather, pulling his hat over his eyes.
“She’s very different from Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she? I’d always imagined her so much the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost as different as it is possible for a mother
to be from her child,” said Giles, while he thought
intently. How it had pleased, how it had lightened
his heart to hear what Toppie had just been saying
of Alix and her return to them; and how dismayed
he knew himself to be by this further stretch of her
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As different as that?” Toppie questioned, and
with the faintest flavour of distress in the question.
“Owen always wrote as if she were lovely, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, as far as that goes she’s lovelier, I suppose.
Where Alix is like a crystal she is like a flower. And
they both have that dignity and security, you know.
Alix is such a dignified little creature, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Beautifully dignified; beautifully secure. I
always feel of Alix that she would be safe, always and
everywhere. Yes; those are just the words for Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s not exactly righteousness, is it?” Giles
went on, finding more words since Toppie liked these
ones. “It’s integrity. Like a little noble Roman girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Integrity. Yes.” Toppie mused on Alix. But then,
alas, she came back to Alix’s mother. “The same in
loveliness; the same in dignity and security.—In
what ways different, then, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that there was hardly anything he could
say of madame Vervier that it would not be unwise to
say. He watched an ant, disturbed by his change of
posture, thread its anxious way amongst the tufts of
heather and felt that he was like the ant. He, too, must
go forward and find the path that promised most
safety. “Well, she’s more impulsive, I feel; more selfish;
less fastidious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie, for a moment, reflected in silence. He saw
her dimly, sitting there beside him, a grey silhouette
against the sky. “Less fastidious?” she then said, and
it was as if he had presented her with an object that
she turned reluctantly, and with surprise, in her hands:
“How strange. Owen gave me no impression of that.
He gave me the impression of someone quite finished,
quite exquisite; in every way. How do you mean less
fastidious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t exactly know,” said Giles, and he
feared it was uneasily. “Merely in the sense, perhaps,
that she’d put up with all sorts of queer people, for the
sake of not being bored, that Alix wouldn’t care to
have. She is exquisite; very exquisite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did like her, didn’t you, Giles? Very, very
much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, hardly very, very,” he qualified, pausing
with wary antennæ, as it were. “She’s not my sort,
really. That’s all that it comes to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not see Toppie’s features, but he felt her
more intent, and in her next words he saw that he had
seemed to call Owen’s taste in question—as well as
madame Vervier’s. “Wasn’t that only because you
didn’t see enough of her? She was so much Owen’s
sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t follow she’d be mine, would it? Owen
and I were really very different, weren’t we, Toppie,
dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; very different. But you always liked the
same people. It surprises me—so much—that you
shouldn’t like Alix’s mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I didn’t say that, Toppie! ‘Liking’ isn’t the
word. She is charming. She is too charming; that’s
what it comes to.” Giles felt himself go forward to
a new outlet. “Too much the woman of fashion;
too sophisticated and highly flavoured for anyone so
simple as I am. You know I am much simpler than
Owen. He was a man of the world, and I, however
long I live, will never be a man of the world. If one’s
just the shambling, shabby, scholastic type one will
never feel at home with brilliant, resourceful people.
It’s as if”—Giles found the simile with satisfaction—“I
liked rice pudding while Owen could appreciate
caviare. Madame Vervier is caviare, as far as I am
concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced up at Toppie to see how she accepted the
metaphor; but if she smiled it was with reserve. “You
like me, Giles. I’m not caviare; but I’m not, I hope,
rice pudding either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t come into such categories,” Giles
smiled back. “If one could find a fruit that tasted of
frost and sunlight, a fruit one could pick only at daybreak—golden,
and chill and sweet—that would be
you, Toppie. A sort of apple of the Hesperides—that
one must sail and sail for ever and a day to find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something that came into his voice made him stop
suddenly. And Toppie, too, was silent for a moment.
When she spoke it was carefully, as if guiding their
steps away from a menace to their quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a charming compliment, Giles,” she said.
“I sometimes think, shambling and shabby though
you call yourself, that you are a poet as well as a philosopher.
But I’m sorry, you know, to feel madame Vervier
lose by what I gain. Owen always wrote of her as
someone he so wanted me to know. I can’t believe he’d
have wanted me to know anyone who was worldly and
luxurious and meretricious. I can’t help feeling that
you must be unjust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meretricious, luxurious, worldly? Was that the picture
he had, all unwittingly, drawn for Toppie? The
blood came to Giles’s face. It was to be displayed to
his own eyes as disloyal. He saw madame Vervier’s
figure standing against the great arch of the sky; he
saw her rising up from the sea at dawn; he smelt the
beeswax and seashells and cool, clean linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t mean that at all,” he stammered. “I
don’t think of her as any of those things. Nothing
could be further from my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she’s like the things rich people eat in restaurants;
if she’s selfish; if she’s unfastidious and resourceful—”
Toppie’s voice built up before him the shape of
madame Vervier as she had seen him draw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t press mere metaphor so far, Toppie.
I said she was like a flower, too. She is as out-of-door a
creature as Alix herself. She belongs more to the cliffs
and the country than to restaurants.—That’s really
the most vivid impression I have of her”—he was
striving to atone to madame Vervier for the false picture
he had put before Toppie; yet trying at the same
time for truth to Toppie. “As I used to see her at
sunrise; coming up from the sea after a morning swim.
Like poetry and music personified, she used to look,
walking against the dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie’s eyes were on him. It was curious how cold
her eyes could be. It was as if, though Toppie herself
were not judging you, the height, the light that her
eyes conveyed revealed you to her as creeping and
dingy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand you,” she said. She spoke gently,
as if to mitigate the coldness that fell from her
gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it you don’t understand, Toppie!”
Giles exclaimed, and he heard that it was with irrepressible
fretfulness. He felt it so unfair that he should be
displayed to Toppie as creeping and dingy when all
that he was trying for was to shield her from any hurt.
Yet that there was another reason for his fretfulness,
he knew. His loyalty to madame Vervier had betrayed
him to too much ardour. Ardour had been in his voice.
And Toppie must have heard it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you should say such different things of
Owen’s friend,” Toppie replied at once. “You contradict
yourself. It’s as if you were hiding something
from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Giles. His hat-brim was drawn down, but that
could not conceal from Toppie the helpless red that
surged up over his face and neck as he heard these
words. He felt it rise, the burning, dark confusion,
while, with sudden fear and sickness of heart, he groped
for an answer. And her blow had been so sudden and
unlooked for that the only answer that came was as
helpless as his blush, “I’m sure I don’t know what
you mean. What could there be to hide?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no escape for him in Toppie’s gaze.
Giles, his eyes fixed on the heather, felt it dwell upon
him, and when, at last, she looked away, it was as if
she had seen the falsity between them. And all that
she said, in accents of snow, was: “I’m sure I don’t
know. Perhaps you will tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie, this is absurd, you know,” Giles muttered,
staring down. “You put me in a ridiculous position.
It upsets one, naturally, to be cross-questioned as if
one were a shifty witness in the witness-box. People
are complicated and contradictory creatures. One
can’t draw a consistent picture of them. On one side
of her nature madame Vervier may be weak and erring
and on the other she may be like a goddess. How do I
know? I’ve hardly seen her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Toppie made an astonishing statement.
Turning her eyes from him, looking before her at the
dull rose sky, coldly, though gently, and with a poise
of tone that showed how deeply she was feeling, she
said: “If you have fallen in love with her, Giles, why
should you not say so? Why should you try to hide it
as though you were ashamed? She is a widow, is she
not? There is no reason, is there, why you should not
love her?—It hurts me that you should speak like
that—keeping things back; twisting your real feelings
lest I should see them.—You speak of her as though
you were ashamed of loving her.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, while Toppie spoke, had started up, resting on
his hand and staring at her with eyes aghast and stupefied.
What folly, what madness was this? How
could Toppie find it in her heart to speak like this; to
him—to him of all people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, in another moment, while he stared at her,
memory had answered him. A vein of piercing intuition
underlay Toppie’s blunder. It was only a half
blunder. His misery of confusion had been for Owen,
because of Owen’s secret that he had to hide. And she
had seen it as for himself. But it was true that he had,
if only for a moment, been in love with madame Vervier.
He had, for a moment, partaken of the experience
that swept men away. The figure of madame Vervier
was haloed for him by fiery, dewy associations, and the
pang of his sense of disloyalty to her would not have
been so deep had he not known in her presence that
poignant, perilous revelation of beauty. He saw all
this while, silently, he stared at Toppie, and he saw
that she could never, never understand or admit his
half truth. It was a weakness even to think of its
avowal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you say anything so monstrous to me,
Toppie,” he questioned, and it was sternly, “when you
know I’ve never loved anyone but you?” This, indeed,
was a whole truth that it behoved Toppie not to
traduce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his sternness did not deflect her. “There are
different kinds of love. I know you love me. I know
you’ve had, always, a boyish, idealizing devotion for
me. I will always be grateful to you for your devotion.
But you are not in love with me. You’ve never known
what it was to be in love till you met madame Vervier.
Oh! Giles—you must see what I see so plainly! Perhaps
you really think that I could be hurt and jealous
in feeling myself no longer first. That is so wrong of
you. It would lift a burden from me if I could see you
married. I should be so glad, so glad of your happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heavens, Toppie!” Giles had started to his
feet and stood above her, crimson with grief and dismay.
“This is the most extraordinary nonsense! Happiness!
With another woman! With Alix’s mother!
She’s old enough to be mine if it comes to that; and
as to marrying me—she’d as soon think of marrying a
Chinaman. People haven’t these romantic ideas about
marrying in France, I can assure you. Marry me!”
Giles suddenly found himself forced by the thought
to a loud laugh. “Besides,” he added, “why should
you think that monsieur Vervier is dead? Why should
you think that madame Vervier is a widow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt in the silence that followed these last unguarded
words that Toppie looked at him strangely
and, as he heard them echo—what, indeed, did he
know about monsieur Vervier, damn him! He had,
actually, never considered monsieur Vervier except as
a discarded, dangling phantom of the past—as he
heard the words that disinterred monsieur Vervier and
set him there between him and Toppie, he felt that the
bewildered ant had, indeed, stumbled on a luckless
path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owen always wrote of her as though she were a
widow,” said Toppie, going slowly. She was not bewildered.
She looked carefully, if with shrinking, at
the figure he had placed before her in his foolish
haste. “But you know so much more about her than
Owen ever knew.—In those few days you saw and
learned things he never saw. Perhaps you do know
about monsieur Vervier. Perhaps you know that he
isn’t dead; that she isn’t free. If that is so—doesn’t
it explain even more?—Oh, Giles—I am afraid”—She
stopped. She looked away. He saw the blood
rising in her cheek as she checked the speech that must
give him too much offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose what you mean,” said Giles gloomily,
thrusting his hands into his pockets as he looked down
at her, “is that I do know she isn’t free, and that,
therefore, being in love with her, my love is a guilty
passion. Something of that sort, what? Well, if you
won’t take my word for it, there’s no more for me to
say, is there?” Resentment had come into his voice.
“We’d better be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I accuse you of nothing, Giles,” said Toppie, still
dyed with her blush; “only I am sure that I am right
in feeling that something has happened. I am sorry,
but I can’t help feeling it. From the moment you
spoke of madame Vervier I heard that your voice was
changed;—so strained and strange; so full of reluctance.
You wanted to say all against her that you
could find to say. You wanted to guard yourself
against your own feeling. But what came through,
from the beginning, was that you found her—beautiful;
mysterious; compelling.” Toppie found the words,
a strange tremor in her voice. “What came through
was that she was a goddess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood motionless, gazing down at her. He was
seeing, suddenly, straight into Toppie’s heart; straight
into the heart of their situation. How futile were his
denials, when he could deny only for himself—and
not for the other. The vein of piercing intuition in
Toppie had led her to the portals of the truth. The
name she saw inscribed there was the wrong name;
that was all. Change Giles to Owen, and the truth was
in her grasp. She knew that madame Vervier was
beautiful, mysterious, compelling. She knew that both
he and Owen had felt her a goddess. A chill of fear
crept about Giles’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come; we’d better be going,” he repeated. He
heard that his voice was harsh. He would discuss no
further and he held out his hand to her. Toppie took
it and rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She meant to be kind to him. She meant to be his
friend;—Giles said it to himself as, silently, they
went down the hill together. But in spite of all his
compassionate understanding of her, his fear for her,
what came over him, in wave after wave of grief and
resentment, was that she was cold and hard. He had
made her suffer because of what she had felt as false in
him; but it was now, as it had always been, of Owen
that she was thinking. He had cast, thank Heaven, no
shadow on Owen; but perplexity, mystery, pain had
come into her vision of Owen’s friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owen never said she was a widow; but I’m sure he
believed her to be one.—Forgive me, Giles, but have
you heard what makes you think she may not be?
What do you know of monsieur Vervier? Alix has
never spoken of him. It is so strange; for if he were
alive he would be with them, would he not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’était un bien méchant homme.</span>” These words, in
madame Vervier’s tones of surpassing detachment,
came back to Giles. “Alix probably never saw him.
Her mother spoke of him. She said he was a bad
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She spoke of him to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she didn’t say whether he were alive or dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. We weren’t talking about him. We were talking
about Alix and her future. Alix will have hardly
any <span class='it'>dot</span>, it seems, because monsieur Vervier made away
with all her mother’s money. They are parted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she leave him, or did he leave her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She left him,” said Giles after a moment and he
felt his voice harden towards Toppie. “Continue your
cross-examination, pray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know so much, so surprisingly much,
Giles. How can I help asking? How can I help feeling
interest in Alix’s mother, in Owen’s friend? It isn’t
cross-examination. It is unkind of you to say that.
Horribly unkind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean to be unkind. It’s you who are unkind,
I think. Ask any questions you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long after her first husband’s death did she
marry monsieur Vervier? May I ask that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly you may,” said Giles. His bitterness
carried him so far. Then he paused, aghast. He had
known that to Toppie Alix could never have spoken
of her mother’s misfortune as frankly as she had to
him. He had forgotten the first misfortune. He was
aghast; but while he made his pause he determined
that there should be no half-measure here. Toppie
should not again accuse him of double-dealing.
“Didn’t Alix ever tell you that her mother was divorced?”
he demanded, and he heard how hard and
dry was his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Toppie said nothing. Then she spoke,
softly, as if in all sincerity she could not believe what
she heard. Disastrous, indeed, was the time for such a
hearing. “What did you say, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix told me, the day I brought her here last winter,
that her father and mother had been divorced. If she
didn’t tell you, that was, no doubt, because she took it
for granted that I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again came Toppie’s dire silence. “And why
didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I? It was none of our affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Alix our affair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly she is. And she has nothing to do with
monsieur Vervier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has something to do with her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Giles’ voice grew harder, dryer. “What she
has to do with her mother we see. She is the product of
her mother. Do you find fault with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached the road that wound among the
birch-woods and dusk had fallen in it. The sky, paled to
a faint apricot tint, shone dimly between the trees.
Toppie stood still on the wayside grass and looked
at him. Ineffaceably, in this instant of strange, unbelievable
alienation (for had he not, in his last words,
challenged Toppie with madame Vervier’s standards
as set against her own?), Toppie’s image was stamped
upon his mind; as ineffaceably as on that first time he
had seen her. And now all her light was withdrawn.
It was the end, as that had been the beginning. Pale,
wraith-like in the dusk, she fixed her eyes upon him
and they were dark with their repudiation. “Alix is
not the product of her mother. Alix is good and her
mother may be bad. You know better than I do what
you think of her mother. It’s you I find fault with,
Giles. Your words don’t tell me what you think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve kept nothing from you,” said Giles. It was a
lie. He knew it, and he saw that Toppie knew it. He
attempted an amendation of his statement. “Everything
you’ve asked I’ve answered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you? I will ask this, then. Did she leave her
husband with monsieur Vervier? Did her husband
divorce her because of monsieur Vervier? Was she unfaithful
to her husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were faults on both sides, I believe. Alix
wouldn’t have been given for half the time to her
mother if there hadn’t been faults on both sides.”
Giles forced himself to speak steadily. “She was very
young. People don’t judge these things so hardly
nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie, her eyes on his, put aside the palliation.
“Did she leave monsieur Vervier with another man?
Was she unfaithful to monsieur Vervier, too? Is she a
woman who has had lovers?” said Toppie, and the
word was strange on her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood there, stricken. He was so aware of
horrible danger, pressing in upon him and Toppie from
every side, that he could hardly command his thoughts
to an order. All that came was a helpless literalness.
There was no refuge from Toppie’s eyes; for her, or for
himself. “Yes,” he said, “I’m afraid she is. That’s the
trouble, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie then looked away from him. She looked
round her, standing so still, with no gesture of amazement
or distress. But there was a sudden wildness in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie, dear Toppie,” Giles pleaded. “She is not
a bad woman. Wrong; but not bad. You can’t judge
of these things. I’m not defending her.—It’s only
that, seeing her, seeing all the beauty she has made in
her life, I cannot feel about her mistakes as I should
have thought I would. That’s why you felt me strained
in speaking of her. It was a shock to me. And I didn’t
want you to know. Put it away now, Toppie, I do beg
of you. It has nothing, nothing to do with us. She’s
a very beautiful, a very unfortunate woman, and it’s
only by chance that we’ve stumbled upon these unhappy
things in her past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the fatal background to his words! He knew
how false they were, spoken to Toppie, for all that
there was of truth in them for himself. “Let’s go
home,” he urged, “and not talk about it any
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie stood, her eyes fixed as if in careful scrutiny
upon the distance. She had raised her hand, as he
spoke, and pressed her fingers, bent, against her lips.
He saw that she kept herself with a great effort from
breaking into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not that,” she uttered with difficulty. “It’s
you.” And now she moved away. “I’m going home
from here. I would rather be alone, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road led over the common to Heathside; there
was a short cut through the woods to the Rectory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Toppie—I do implore you.” Poor Giles
with his rough head and great round eyes stood and
pleaded. “What have I done? What have you against
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s everything, everything,” Toppie murmured.
“It’s all I’ve felt in you this afternoon. I’ve stumbled—from
one hidden thing to another.—It gives me
dreadful thoughts. It’s as if”—she stopped again,
her eyes still fixed on the distance—“as if there might
be anything. She’s changed you so much.” And, her
eyes coming to him at last, she spoke on, helpless in the
urgency of her half-seen fear:—“It’s as if she might
have changed Owen;—if he had ever come to know
her as well as you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, at this climax, Giles found himself prepared.
“What if she had?” he demanded, and it was
like riding, with a great thrust, to the top of the
breaker that threatened to engulf them. “What if she
had made him judge things more kindly? No doubt
she would have changed him. He would have felt her
beauty, too. But she wouldn’t have changed him towards
you, Toppie; any more than she has me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Toppie drew back. Seeing suddenly where she
stood, seeing her fear as a disloyalty, she drew away.
She looked at Giles and he saw the door, as it were,
mercifully or terribly close against him and Toppie,
demanding no further lies, shut herself away. “Perhaps
you are right,” she said slowly, and each word
came with an effort, for they were, doubtless, the only
false words Toppie had ever uttered. “Perhaps I am
too ignorant of the world. I do not judge your friend.
But if I knew her, I could not think her beautiful. I
could not think a wicked woman beautiful. We must
be different in that.—I’ll go home now. I’d rather be
alone. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved away into the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, standing where she left him, had the sensation
of feeling his heart break. “Toppie,” he said in a
choking voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped and looked round at him. Her grey
form among the birches was almost invisible, but he
saw the thin oval of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie.”—Only this—He could hardly speak.
He was not thinking. Only that stifling pressure in his
heart seemed to break its way out into words—“I do
so love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that he touched her. If not his words, then
his face of anguish. For the first time that day, if only
for a moment, her thought was given to him alone and
he felt rather than saw pity in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles—I’m so sorry,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do so love you,” he repeated, gazing at her. But,
even as he gazed, the worst of the anguish was to know
that something in his love was changed for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Giles,” Toppie murmured again. “Forgive
me.” And again she repeated, and the phrase was like
a fall of snow: “I’m so sorry.”</p>

<div><h1>PART III</h1></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>What had happened to Giles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was waiting for her on the Victoria platform and
his patient gaze and poise told her that her train was
late;—but fatigue did not account for what Alix saw
at once as she stood at the door of her carriage and
found his face. Her dear Giles. Her good Giles. What
had happened to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was aware that a great deal had happened to
herself since she had last seen Giles, only two months
ago. It was not only her lengthened skirts and her
turned-in locks that gave her her new sense of maturity.
Perhaps one only began really to be grown up when
one began to know why one was unhappy. A child
suffers in ignorance of the cause of its suffering and it
can forget more easily because of that merciful vagueness.
Unhappiness is only a cloud to put away or pass
out of. But grown-up unhappiness was four solid walls
of fact enclosing one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Groping round and round her prison and finding
always that solid facts were there resisting all attempts
at forgetfulness, Alix, though she still could not see
just what they were, sometimes asked herself if that
was because she was still too young to understand, or
because Maman, so deftly, so tenderly, with as much
compassion as compunction, passed a bandage round
her eyes and kept her blindfolded? She could not tell;
but she knew that another mark of her own maturity
was her understanding of Maman, her new capacity
for helping her; and more than in any other way she
helped her by never lifting a hand to push away the
bandage and by never asking a question that Maman
might find it difficult to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had known intuitively, in the past, that some
questions must not be asked; questions about her
father; about monsieur Vervier; about divorce. But
now there were more pressing questions, and the first
and foremost of them was the question of André de
Valenbois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was there; in their lives. She had left him behind
her in Paris; no longer their guest, but as much as at
Les Chardonnerets the presiding presence. He was a
great friend. So Maman had said to her, strangely
pale, on that night when at Les Chardonnerets she had
heard Giles and André de Valenbois talk of her return
to England. Maman had great friends. And great
friends made one suffer—Maman had not said that
but Alix had seen it—and many things in life must be
sacrificed to them. It was not that they were more
loved than a child—oh, she was sure not!—though
that was a surmise that had pierced her through; it
was simply that one could not be sure of keeping them
always; as one was sure of keeping one’s child; and because
one was not sure, one suffered. It was something
from which one could not free oneself. It was something
that made one helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Alix knew herself changed; a grave, meditative
person; garnering in her silence and her submissiveness
a power to meet all the emergencies that must lie
in her path since, so obviously, they lay in Maman’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Alix,” said Giles. His eyes had found her
and he was there below her, taking from her the basket
she had lifted off the seat; and she said, “Hello, Giles,”
though it seemed to her always such an odd phrase to
meet upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the kitten?” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. This is Blaise. You expected him? I wrote
to Mrs. Bradley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expected him! Rather! They’re wanting to see
him almost as much as to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is well, then,” Alix smiled. “You haven’t
been ill, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ill! Rather not! I’m as right as rain,” said Giles;
and he added, hastily she felt: “But I say, you’re
quite different. What is it? Your clothes? Your hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maman thought I was getting too old for short
hair. It is taken back from my forehead, too. It makes
me very <span class='it'>digne</span>, I assure you. And my skirts are nearly
as long, you see, as anybody’s skirts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix wore a dark blue dress and a dark blue cape,
buttoned with little buttons on her breast and showing
a satin lining of striped grey and blue. Her shoes
and stockings were grey, and her loose, long gloves,
and her soft little hat curving down over her brows
with the big bow knotted at the side. Maman had
made her, though so sober, very <span class='it'>chic</span>, and Giles was
taking it all in; as far as he could; and that, she feared,
with tender irony, was not very far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, as they moved along the platform, pursued the
topic of her appearance, feeling it evidently opportune.
He did not wish to speak about his own. “It’s that you
look so tremendously foreign;—the way you walk;
the way your things are put on; the way your hat
comes down like that. Even the way you speak English
is as French as possible, for anyone who speaks it
perfectly; and I’d never noticed that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you first met me,” said Alix, putting the
obvious explanation with mild competence before him,
“what chiefly engaged your attention was that I spoke
English at all. Now you notice that though I speak it
so well I speak with my French accent. I am French,
Giles.” She slightly smiled round at him, for she need
not emphasize it. He as well as she would remember
their last talk on the cliff-path. “I am a foreigner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you are,” said Giles, and it was gravely,
almost gloomily that he said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the walking tour a success?” Alix asked him,
while they waited at the customs, Alix’s box, this time,
being larger than the last and subjected to the vicissitudes
of a separate transit. “You did not overtire
yourself? You look a little tired, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I really? I haven’t been sleeping very well; it’s
been so hot. Cornwall was a great success. I want
you to see Cornwall some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been hot in Paris, too. But I always love
Paris at this season, the stones all baked with sun, the
trees all bronze. We have been dining in the Bois almost
every night, at a little restaurant under the trees.
It has been delicious. And the drive back down the
avenue du Bois.—<span class='it'>Calme-toi, mon chéri</span>,” she addressed
the kitten who was wailing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little chap. He hasn’t liked the journey. Is
he prettier?” asked Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is uglier,” said Alix. “It is <span class='it'>l’âge ingrat</span>, you
know. No longer kitten, and yet not cat. Like me. It
is only the basket that troubles him. I had him out for
most of the day, in my arms, and he was quiet and
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It reassures me to see you still so fond of kittens,”
Giles smiled at her. “It makes me feel you are still
something of one yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall always be fond of kittens,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were again to spend the night with Aunt Bella
and in the taxi Alix opened the basket and displayed
her pet. Very ugly indeed; gaunt in structure, though
fully fed, of a most undistinguished white and brindle,
with a nose already over-long and ears over-large; but
as it nestled into Alix’s neck with loud choking purrs
Giles owned that it was a nice little beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so full of love; and so intelligent, Giles,” said
Alix, pleased by his commendation. “More loving,
more intelligent, these common little cats are, than
<span class='it'>chats de race</span>, I always think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>London, dusty and drowsy on this Autumn evening,
seemed to yawn and smile and had, Alix thought, a
welcoming air. It was a kind city. She even saw
beauty in it, and commented on the Royal Hospital as
they drove through Chelsea. “How well it goes in the
thick, soft air—that period, that colour.” She had
never liked London so much, although she came to it
with an unwillingness so much greater than the unwillingness
of last year, and it seemed to her, leaning
back in the taxi beside Giles, her kitten against her
cheek, that the dropped aitches, the little green-grocer’s
shops, the strolling lovers, and the river gliding
silvery-grey behind its trees, all went together in the
impression of ease and kindliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Aunt Bella’s flat all the windows were widely
opened to the freshness, and Aunt Bella received not
only her, but Blaise, quite as a matter of course. This
matter-of-courseness, Alix had begun to feel, was a
distinctive English trait. Once they knew you, they
accepted you; you and your kittens. They had no
surmises about you. You were simply there. Was it,
Alix wondered, while she changed her dress in her little
pink room—Blaise cautiously reconnoitring from
piece to piece of the furniture—was it that Aunt
Bella saw her benevolently as an <span class='it'>œuvre de guerre</span>, or
sentimentally as a legacy from the dead nephew? As
she reflected on her own presence, so intimately among
them, Alix felt that if Maman’s motives were mysterious
to her from their complexity, Aunt Bella’s would
be mysterious from their simplicity. And it was all
like London again; like the cosy little shops with the
carrots and cabbages heaped before their windows, the
muffling air and unadventurous river. There was peace
in such simplicity, peace in being among people who
had nothing to hide and who would hardly be able to
imagine that you might have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt at dinner that Aunt Bella looked at her, in
her altered way of dressing, a little as Miss Grace and
Jennifer had looked when Lady Mary talked to her
about Henri de Mouveray. Aunt Bella, no doubt,
found the little dress that Maman had so cleverly contrived
out of two Empire scarves, curious rather than
interesting. Charming in colour, dull blue shot with
silver, it was a marvel of convenience as well as so
pretty. One turn and it fell into place, leaving arms
and shoulders bare, knotting low about the hips and
falling in long silvery fringes to the ankle. Seen in
Aunt Bella’s flat it had undoubtedly a very Parisian
air, and perhaps Aunt Bella felt it too Parisian, for she
began to question Alix about France’s foreign policy
with some severity. Alix gathered that in Aunt Bella’s
eyes her country was behaving badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we want the Germans to suffer,” she said. “If
they are not made to suffer sufficiently, they will make
us suffer again and perhaps destroy us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is being revengeful, my dear child. And
so short-sighted, too. You don’t change people’s hearts
by making them suffer. You harm yourself as well as
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think we want to change their hearts.”
Alix, all unversed in these large subjects as she was,
felt herself impelled to make the answer so obvious to
every French mind. “I do not think we care about
their hearts. When a bad man is guillotined, it is sufficient
that his head should be gone. His heart does not
concern us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles at this laughed loudly and Aunt Bella’s eye-glassed
gaze turned to glitter reprobation at him.
“She doesn’t know what she’s saying, Giles. She is too
young to have followed or understood the lamentable
policy of her country. You really shouldn’t encourage
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it seems to me she has been following. She’s
made the only honest answer. Have you heard people
talking about it a good deal, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mind his mirth or Aunt Bella’s reprobation.
She did not care at all what they thought about
France. How could one expect even English friends
really to understand? “I have heard people talk at
Maman’s,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise was on a chair beside her eating an excellent
dinner, and Giles, still laughing, said: “Do you know
what he looks like? A Boche baby. There was one
born in a village we occupied after the Germans had
been there for two years. It was the funniest, jolliest
little fellow; but awfully ugly; with a face just like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was half French, I imagine,” said Alix dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly half French, I regret to say. But he
looked all German. And I’m sure that if you’d had to
take care of him you’d have been as kind to him as you
are to your kitten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not care for babies,” Alix objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have been kind to him all the same. You
wouldn’t have wanted to see his head cut off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not want to see anyone’s head cut off; but if it
were a choice between a Boche and a French baby, I
should choose the French one to live. That is all we
ask of our allies,” Alix added, looking over at Giles
with kindly determination; “to help us to live;—as
we have helped them;—even at the expense of the
Germans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Bella, now, changed the subject. “How is
Mr. Westmacott, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No better, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they a trained nurse yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t have one. He won’t admit he’s so bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be very taxing for Enid.” (Aunt Bella always
called Toppie by her real name.) “How does she
bear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looks very worn,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m afraid she won’t be at all well off when he
dies,” said Aunt Bella, as though she placed Toppie’s
approaching bereavement and subsequent impoverishment
in the same category. “She won’t be able to go
on living in the way she does now. And she has been
trained to no profession. I have always so blamed Mr.
Westmacott for keeping her with him and giving her
no education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toppie is educated, I think,” said Giles, dryly,
but his dryness did not conceal from Alix the distress
Aunt Bella’s surmises caused him. How much more
capable Aunt Bella was, Alix reflected, of sympathizing
with large vague masses of humanity than with one
human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not educated at all from the modern point of
view,” she returned decisively. “Quite incapable of
making her own living. A very dear, good girl, but a
useless girl, and there is no room in the world nowadays
for useless people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s room for Toppie,” said Giles coldly; and
then, perhaps, Aunt Bella remembered that he had a
special feeling about Toppie, for she desisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know Toppie’s father was so ill,” Alix said
to Giles when he and she were for a little while alone
in the drawing-room, Aunt Bella engaged on the telephone
in the hall. “I had only one letter from her,
from Bournemouth, and it did not lead me to think he
was so seriously ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid he is. She didn’t realize it then, perhaps.
I’m afraid it’s only a question of time now,” said Giles,
sunk in a deep chair and watching her while she pretended
to play with Blaise. Was it grief, anxiety
about Toppie, that had wrought the change in him?
It had to do with Toppie she felt sure; but had it to do
with her as well? Aunt Bella still issued directions on
the telephone and Alix felt suddenly that she must ask
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles,” she said, not looking up from Blaise, who
made soft onslaughts at her hand, “does Toppie
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know?” His echo had the strangest reverberations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About Captain Owen is what I mean;—that he
cared so much for Maman.” She looked down at
Blaise and moved her knotted handkerchief before his
nose; and she felt the colour rising in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was because he felt her confusion and
shared it that he had to pause before replying. “Of
course she doesn’t know,” he then said very gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will not forget what you promised me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I promise you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That if she did know she would still want me back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again there was a silence. How carefully Giles
was considering his answer was made apparent by the
length of the silence; but what he said finally, more
gently than ever, seemed clear. “I’m more sure of that
than ever, Alix. You see, she’s so fond of you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>If Toppie, too, was changed, she was not changed to
her. That was the first thing that Alix felt when she
saw her again; next day;—for a note had been waiting
for her at Heathside asking her to come to the
Rectory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a hot, still day and a bee was droning lazily
about the Rectory drawing-room, flying out into the
sunlight and in again to the bowl of mignonette that
stood on a table near the window; and the bee made
the day more still. It had been strange to find herself
thinking of Racine as she waited for Toppie. Nothing
so trivial and intimate as a bee could be imagined in
any play of Racine’s; yet its soft drone had accompanied
her sense of a pause, of an ominous interlude,
like the pause before a scene where the heroine was to
enter with some quiet, conclusive word. It was, perhaps,
because of this association of ideas that Toppie,
when she entered, had looked to her like the Racine
heroine, like a creature delicate and austere, dimly
conscious of an impending doom. There was fear in
Toppie’s face as it found her there. Alix saw its white
gleam mastered, resolutely veiled, while, at the same
moment, the full security of Giles’s assurance was
brought warmly home to her by Toppie’s encircling
arms, by a new note of emotion in her voice as she said,
kissing her, “Dear, dear child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was changed; but it could not be because of
her. It was her father’s illness that had changed her
and Giles had spoken the whole truth; but all the same,
involuntarily, she found herself saying, while Toppie’s
arms were still around her: “Are you glad to have me
back?” And she heard that her voice trembled in
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever the fear had been, Toppie had mastered
it. She held her by the shoulders and looked at
her, smiling, and said: “So glad, dear little Alix, that
I feel we ought to keep you always.” Then she held
her off and looked her up and down, still smiling, and
added: “But it isn’t a child any longer. It’s an almost
grown-up young person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange to feel herself, all reassured as she
was, wanting dreadfully to cry; but Alix, too, was an
adept at mastering emotion, and she said, taking off
her hat so that Toppie should see all the changes: “Do
you like my hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it very much.” Toppie kept her hand, turning
her round. “I like seeing your forehead, such a
gentle, thoughtful forehead. I like that big black bow
at your neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a <span class='it'>jeune fille</span> bow—a bow of transition,”
smiled Alix. “It is to be there while the hair grows
long enough to make a knot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it all,” said Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down on the sofa side by side, Toppie still
holding her hand, and then she said: “Toppie, I had
not realized from your letter that your father was
so ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie looked at her in silence for a moment and,
slowly, her eyes filled with tears. “He is going to leave
me, Alix,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her father, then. Alix could not but feel the
deep, selfish relief. “Oh, you must hope,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do try to hope. I try to live on hope. But I am
afraid he is going to leave me,” Toppie repeated. “He
is not much changed,” she went on, for Alix found
nothing to say. “You will not see much change in him,
I am sure. I will take you up to him presently. He
likes to follow what goes on. In a way he follows more
than he has ever done. It is a sort of clinging, I think.
And he is quite cut off from his own work. I read to
him a great deal. Perhaps you will come sometimes
and read to him in French. He likes that, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it, too. You must let me come often. It is
curious, Toppie, but when Giles is away my English
life is really here with you; not that I am not very fond
of them all at Heathside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” Toppie looked at her very intently. “I am
glad of that. Glad that I can mean home to you.—Dear
little Alix.—But you <span class='it'>are</span> fond of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially of Mrs. Bradley. Only she is there so
little. One hardly sees her. I am fond of Ruth and
Rosemary, too. But I would rather be with you.”
Alix smiled a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it will be Rosemary only this winter, since
Ruth is going to Oxford. I am glad she is to be there.
Giles will like having her near him.” Toppie spoke
calmly the name of Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” said Alix. “Do you think she
means much to Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is devoted to all his family. It will certainly
be a pleasure to him to have her,” said Toppie, and
Alix now thought she detected in her voice a strange
detachment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is fond of them to do things for them; not to be
with them—I mean his sisters. He is so unlike his
sisters; and most of all unlike Ruth. Ruth is so stupid
beside Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a very good girl; very courageous and honest,”
said Toppie. “I think I see Ruth’s good points
more than I used to. I think, Alix, the older one grows,
the more one cares for those sterling qualities. Black
would always be black to Ruth, and white, white.
That has value, the highest value, in a person’s character,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in Toppie’s tone now dimly offended
Alix. “But you could not really compare Ruth and
Giles, Toppie. Giles is all that she is and so much more
besides. He sees the greys and all the delicate in-between
shades, too. Nothing is really black or white,
and that is what is so stupid in Ruth; she sees things
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sometimes seems to me that they are nothing
else,” said Toppie very calmly. “And Ruth has, I
think, because of that downrightness in her, more
strength of character than Giles. He would so much
more easily be mistaken;—misled.” Toppie paused
before finding these words. “He has what would be
called the artistic temperament, I suppose; and that is
the penalty one pays for having it; a certain weakness;
a certain yielding. I feel that Giles would yield where
Ruth would stand up like granite;—and I like the
granite thing in people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix sat in indignant astonishment. “I have never
known anyone so true as Giles,” she said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not say that he was not true,” Toppie returned,
with a touch of severity. “I said that he would
be more easily misled than Ruth. I said that he was
weaker than Ruth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat for a few strange moments silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is as if you were changed to Giles,” Alix
cried suddenly. She could not repress the cry. “What
is it, Toppie? What has he done to displease you? You
are unkind to him. You speak as if you did not care for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep blush rose in Toppie’s face; but it was not the
blush of surprise or confusion. Alix saw a competent
sternness in the eyes bent upon her. “You must not
say things like that,” Toppie said slowly, considering
every word. “There are things you do not understand.
I shall always care for Giles. I have not changed to
him. No,” she repeated as if to herself, “I have not
changed to Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat there, still hand in hand. Alix felt that she
wished to fling Toppie’s hand aside. In answer to her
sternness she had felt an instant anger rise within her.
That Toppie should reprove, rebuff her, was itself an
affront she bore with difficulty—and bore only because
she feared to damage Giles’s cause by rejoinder;
but her anger passed the personal wrong by and
fastened itself, strangely, inevitably, on the figure of
Captain Owen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Toppie herself, in the picture she had drawn
of Giles, who had set him so vividly before her. Captain
Owen, not Giles, was the person who would blur
black into grey; Captain Owen was the person who,
in comparison with honest Ruth, lacked something.
Giles was everything that his brother had not been,
and yet it was Captain Owen who had betrayed Toppie—she
found the word and it sank with a cold weight
on her heart;—it was Captain Owen, now, she felt
sure of it, who parted Giles and Toppie. She sat, her
eyes fixed proudly before her; her lips hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix,” Toppie said in a gentle voice, “if so much
has changed in my life—you mustn’t change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It feels to me as if it were you who were changed,
Toppie,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must forgive me, then,” said Toppie with her
firm gentleness. “I am not quite myself, perhaps. I
am rather on edge. I know I seemed to speak harshly.
You see, dear Alix, you are still, really, a child—one
cares for you so much that one forgets it. But there
are things you cannot understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I understand some things better than you
do, Toppie,” Alix returned, still not looking at her
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that, for a moment, Toppie sat quite silent.
“Perhaps you do,” she then said. “Some things, perhaps
you do. But I feel sure that you do not understand
the things I am speaking of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that they tried to talk as if nothing had happened.
Toppie’s manner had an atoning sweetness.
Once or twice, in the way she spoke, the way she looked
at her, it was as if, Alix felt, one of Toppie’s doves had
spread its brooding wings over her, protectingly, tenderly.
She knew that she had not forgiven Toppie; and
yet she was the fonder of her because she had not forgiven
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was taken up to see Mr. Westmacott, who sat
at an open window, a reading-table before him with
books upon it. Sitting there, as formally courteous
as ever, with his tall pale head and eyes still clearly
blue, he did not look so ill. It was more in his voice
as he questioned her about her journey that she felt
change. His voice had become dry and brittle, like a
glacial wind fluttering the leaves of an old abandoned
volume that no one would ever read again. He would
soon die; Alix felt sure of that as she heard him. He
would die, and Toppie would leave the Rectory and
wander forth desolate, among her doves. Why, oh,
why, would she not see and understand Giles? Why
would she not marry him? “Oh, if I could see her
married to Giles,” she thought, when she had said
good-bye to Toppie and was out again upon the common.
“If I could only help Giles so that he should
marry her, it would have been worth while that I
should have come to England!” And that there was
mistake, misunderstanding between Giles and Toppie,
she was now sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had gone halfway across the dried heather,
when, as on the evening of her first visit to the Rectory,
she saw Giles approaching her, Jock at his heels, and
she knew now, as she had then only felt instinctively,
that he had been waiting for her and that he was
afraid of something. Of the same thing; yet of more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jock saw her and raced ahead to jump against her
knees. He was still her special pet among the dogs and
had received Blaise kindly. Alix stooped to caress his
head while she watched Giles approach her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how did you find Toppie?” he asked simply,
as they met.—Giles not true! Giles easily misled!
Alix felt herself suddenly blushing with anger as the
thought of Toppie’s strange delusion returned to her.
Giles drew her arm within his and they went across
the common towards the birch-wood. It gave her
a deep feeling of consolation that he should thus seek
refuge with the one person who could understand him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find her changed, Giles,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way changed?” said Giles quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as quickly Alix answered: “Not at all to me,
Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see how desperately ill her father is, don’t
you?” said Giles. “She’s quite worn out with nursing
him, you know. In what way do you feel her changed?”
he repeated, looking down into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was pondering. She was not a person who believed
in black and white. She believed in the greys
and the in-between shades. She did not mean to tell
Giles how she thought Toppie changed. What she found
to say was: “If Toppie were happier she would not be
so hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard?” She was looking at the ground, but she
heard in Giles’s voice how the word startled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think Toppie hard?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she is,” said Giles after a moment, “it’s because
of what you say—that she is unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And because she is too sure,” said Alix. They had
entered the birch-wood and their footsteps rustled in
the fallen golden leaves. They went forward, aimlessly,
not thinking of where they went, Alix intent on her
reading of Toppie, Giles listening. “Too sure of what
she loves and believes in. She has had to be too sure,
because she is so unhappy.—Is that it, Giles? And
the things she loves and believes in are not the things
she sees. Perhaps that makes us hard—if we can only
think of the things we love and never see or touch them—makes
us hard, I mean, to the things we have with
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was, she knew, keeping his eyes on her as she
put together these suggestions, and as he meditated
for a little pause, her thoughts, in the silence, while she
watched the golden leaves, took a long flight to France
and she found herself suddenly wondering if perhaps
Maman and André de Valenbois were wandering under
the autumnal trees in the Bois—as Giles had seen
Maman and Captain Owen wander under the Spring
trees. And with the thought came such a pang of fear
and grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, I think,” Giles said. “And I see
no help for it. She’ll grow more and more away
from the things she has with her and shut herself more
and more into her solitude—where she is safe with
the things she can’t see.—What can we do about it,
Alix?” said Giles gently, a little as if he spoke to a
child from whose ingenuous wisdom he sought an
oracle.—“Who can help Toppie in any way in which
she’d accept help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly it was very easy, there in the twilight
woods, to be courageous. She was so near Giles. It was
as if her heart beat in his side. “No one can do anything
for her but you, Giles. You must marry her and
make her happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear little Alix,” he said, smiling bitterly,
not even pausing to assess her daring, just as she herself
had not needed to pause. “There’s no hope for me.
No one can help her less than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean there never was hope;—or is none
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There never was, perhaps;—but there’s less now.
Her heart is full of Owen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet if he had not been there, it would have been
you she would have loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can tell? Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is it because of him that there’s less hope,
even, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put it like that if you choose,” said Giles. “Yes.
Because of him.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The old life flowed round her again, outwardly the
same, inwardly so altered. She had been, she saw it,
like nothing but a glass of <span class='it'>eau sucrée</span> when she had first
come to Heathside;—or if that was a simile too insipid
for even her youngest consciousness, like <span class='it'>eau sucrée</span>
with a squeeze of lemon in it. Now the wine of new
perceptions, new emotions, tinged her deeply, and because
she was enriched she saw a richer world about her.
English history, from being a mere flat picture, dull at
best compared to the splendid pageantry of France,
began to take on depth and distance in her eyes. It
was English history she saw now when she went up to
Oxford with Giles and Ruth, and English history was
English character; whereas event, in French history,
played so much more potent a part. Wandering in
and out with Giles, the beauty of the town, with its
significance, stole upon her mind and senses. Meditative,
benign, and so humane, it seemed to smile at you
like an old ecclesiastic with kindly eyes for youth. As one
sat in a sun-steeped garden or dim, carved chapel, one
felt its quiet like that of a tree, full of life and growth,
so that, though it was old, it was also young; the sap
moved on to fresh leaves while the calm old trunk endured.
Time had been distilled and preserved in it
without a break or cleavage and its very light, she felt,
in this autumnal weather, had that colour of time, as
though it came through ancient glass. The quadrangles
were brimmed with time and it brooded on the lawns
of Saint John’s where the Michaelmas daisies growing
against the grey stone walls made her think of the
ring on the benignant hand of the bishop. “One would
grow wise by being here even if one only sat still, like
this, and looked at it,” she said to Giles. “I only wish
one did!” said Giles. But he felt what she felt and was
pleased with her for, at last, understanding his Oxford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to wish for wisdom. Back at Heathside
she bicycled to the High School every morning with
Rosemary, through the birch-wood, past the red-brick
villas of the town—villas upon which time had laid no
kindly hand—and all the ugliness that had so fretted
her fell into an insignificant background, since, for the
first time, the day had its object. Knowledge, of course,
was quite different from wisdom. The happy life depended
on eyes to see the hands that blessed and the
smile on the face of time; but it was knowledge that
opened one’s eyes and she found in its acquisition a
zest and an enfranchisement. It was in order that she
might see that smile in France that she worked so hard.
The sooner was she equipped, the sooner could she return
to France and Maman. Already she outdistanced
Rosemary, and she had a touch of kindly malice at seeing
her friend of the chaffing complacencies and cheerful
bullying left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosemary was not ungenerous. She showed her
chagrin and her admiration, openly. “It’s not even as
if it were your own language,” she grumbled. “And
you don’t seem to take half the trouble over it that I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it is because you are in your own country
and I out of mine,” Alix suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what on earth do you mean by that?” Rosemary
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing else to do but think about my
studies,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosemary stared. “You’ve got the same things to
think about that I have. Surely you are at home by
now. All the girls like you and you’re never left out of
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not anything like that. Everybody is as kind
as possible,” said Alix. She could not, she knew, make
Rosemary understand. Rosemary, fundamentally,
could not take foreign countries seriously—could not
believe that anyone lucky enough to be in England
should have all their energies bent on leaving it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you girls intend to do with yourselves?”
Mrs. Bradley asked them one day at the
firelit tea-table. She had, as usual, a pile of papers beside
her and laid down her fountain pen to pour out the
tea. “Alix is doing so well that she can really begin to
think of choosing a career and it’s not too soon to turn
things in that direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even dear Mrs. Bradley took it for granted that she
might be quite satisfied to make a career out of her
own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I shall marry when I go back to Maman,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now isn’t she altogether too priceless, Mummy!”
cried Rosemary. “One would have thought that with
all the time you’ve been in England, Alix, you’d have
got over those French ideas about marriage.—I suppose
you’ll actually say that you’d let your mother
choose a husband for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who would choose one so well?” said Alix. Yet
it was not true; it was not true that she still believed
this of Maman. England had already changed her so
much. But she did not intend that Rosemary should
guess it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would? Why, you yourself!” cried Rosemary.
“What can your mother know about it? Aren’t you an
individual with your own tastes and feelings? And
do you seriously think marriage the only career for a
woman?—Do you really think getting married the
whole meaning of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a sad thing to be a <span class='it'>vieille fille</span>, I think,” said
Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sad? Why sad? You don’t call Aunt Bella sad, do
you? And there’re thousands and thousands more like
her. All of ’em as jolly as possible; the unmarried
people nowadays. Jollier than the married ones, I
think;—and no wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In their hearts, you may be sure, they wish they
did not have to be quite so jolly,” Alix demurred.
“They must feel it sad when they reflect that they
have only other people’s children to care for—and
those not the most interesting. And it must be sad to
be alone at one’s <span class='it'>foyer</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One may have one’s own children and yet have to
take care of the others, too, you know, Alix,” Mrs.
Bradley smiled, finishing her tea and taking up a packet
of case papers. “All these are other people’s children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One needn’t care for one’s own, or for other people’s
unless one wants to,” Rosemary commented. “People
specialize nowadays and know that some women are
maternal and some aren’t. I’m sure I’m not. I couldn’t
be bothered with children, or with a husband either—It’s
as good as a play to hear you talk, you know,
Alix—all your quaint French ideas. What can one
hope of a nation that still has them!—Cradles,
hearthstones, hubby’s socks to mend;—that’s what
really appeals to you, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What appeals to me is to be established,” said Alix.
“I do not care for babies; but they are a part of marriage,
and no doubt one would come to like them when
one had them. As for the socks—I should hope to
marry well enough to have a maid to do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosemary’s eyes rounded. “You mean you’d marry
for money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix smiled: “You are so <span class='it'>réaliste</span> in some ways,
Rosemary, and so romantic in others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope, dear, you’d never think of marrying for
money,” Mrs. Bradley put in. “Money is a very minor
consideration in marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Romantic! I romantic!—It’s merely a question
of one’s own dignity!” cried Rosemary; while Alix said:
“There would have to be character and taste and position
as well;—but don’t you think, <span class='it'>chère Madame</span>,
that it is well to marry suitably?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suitably? Yes, of course.” Mrs. Bradley was
gently bewildered. “But the most suitable thing of all
is to marry someone one loves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix, in silence, wondered.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Westmacott seemed a little better now. She
went to the Rectory twice a week and read aloud in
French to him and Toppie. He seemed to enjoy it and
followed if she read very slowly and distinctly. Toppie
sat, her fair head bent over her knitting. She was knitting
endless little vests for the poor babies of one of
Mrs. Bradley’s charities. Alix wondered sometimes
what was to become of all those babies. Were they
passed on from Mrs. Bradley to more Mrs. Bradleys,
until, at last, in one of the hospitals administered by
the Aunt Bellas, they closed their eyes? Would some
be good citizens and some mere beasts of burden, and
some, perhaps, thieves and scoundrels? All were to
begin with those little snowy woollen vests, and all
were to end in coffins. It made her feel strange to think
of it. But when she expressed something of these
thoughts to Toppie one day, Toppie looked at her very
gravely, and said: “They are all to end in heaven, Alix.
We are all of us only that; souls setting out on our
journey.” But Alix found it so difficult to think of
some people as souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The babies’ vests were a strange accompaniment to
Saint-Simon’s “Mémoires.” She found these on Giles’s
shelves and asked Toppie if they would do. She had so
often heard André de Valenbois and monsieur de Maubert
and Maman quote Saint-Simon. Neither Toppie
nor her father had read him and were quite contented
with her choice, and she skipped about and found the
people who most interested her. The French was
strange, but it seemed to say more than modern French.
The strangeness, she saw, was not apparent to Toppie
and her father, nor was the acid irony nor the often unconscious
humour. Toppie and her father rarely found
anything to laugh at. Mr. Westmacott’s chief preoccupation
was to follow the relationships of the characters
and to place them correctly against the background
of contemporaneous history, and for this purpose
there were many interruptions while Toppie went
to fetch the encyclopædia. Alix saw that Toppie sometimes
listened with a vague distress. Saint-Simon and
the people he wrote of were as alien to her understanding—to
say nothing of her sympathies—as the
Chinese. To Alix, for all the travesty of their tails
and crests, they were clearly recognizable types. She
saw the court of Louis Quatorze as a great golden
aviary where splendid creatures, plumed, absurd,
and beautiful, paced and preened and surreptitiously
pecked at each other beneath the proud gaze of the
monstrous bird of paradise on the throne. There was
something sinister about them, there behind their bars;
but something familiar and lovable too. Toppie only
saw them as the denizens of a rather disagreeable
fairy-tale, though at some moments of the recital,
obscure to Alix, she saw that Toppie’s eyes rested
upon her in a cogitativeness that seemed aware of too
much reality. “They are all odious people, Alix,” she
said to her one day. “Odious; vindictive; vulgar and
wicked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh; but not all, Toppie. Some are very good, like
Fénélon—though Saint-Simon is unfair to him; and
some are charming, like the Duchess de Bourgogne.
She was too fond of pleasure, perhaps; but she is so
merry and amusing that one can forgive her that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much too fond, I am afraid,” said Toppie,
colouring above her knitting. “I do not like her,
Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you feel the book unsuitable for our young
friend, Toppie,” Mr. Westmacott observed, “why
should we not read ‘Corinne’? I remember finding
madame de Staël very interesting and any young girl
could read her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there are wicked people in all history,” cried
Alix, aghast at this suggestion. “You all read Shakespeare,
though he is full of wickedness. It is the point
of view. The point of view of Saint-Simon is not
wicked. He is ill-tempered, disagreeable, but upright;
he means always to tell the truth. And then he was so
devout, Monsieur; he was such a devout Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was wily of her, and Mr. Westmacott, easily
reassured, agreed; “Yes, yes, I see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Giles came home for the holidays, Toppie and
her father had gone again to Bournemouth. “She
might have waited a week longer, so that I could see
her,” said Giles sadly. It was still taken happily for
granted that Alix should sit with Giles in the mornings.
There were fires everywhere this Winter, but she was
more than ever glad of the refuge. Ruth had become
a rather overwhelming presence. She had made new
friends at Somerville and spent the first fortnight of
her holidays with them in London, going to art-student
dances in Chelsea and medical-student dances in
Bloomsbury, and returning to her home with what
Alix felt to be many a foolish flourish added to her
sensible signature. She addressed Alix as “dear old
ass,” and her favourite exclamation was “God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so unlike our <span class='it'>mon Dieu</span>,” Alix could not forbear
writing to Maman. “It is as if one saw a hen suddenly
lay an ostrich egg—and so proud of it. I think
when English people like Ruth become emancipated,
they are very like hens laying ostrich eggs. There is
such a strain; and, when it is all over, it is not an interesting
object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth had been meant by nature to be like Aunt
Bella, though with much of beauty added. She was
tall and large and brightly fair. She had little gaiety,
but she gave an impression of massive cheerfulness;
and it knocked you down if you impeded it, and
strode, almost gravely, on its way. Alix was pleased to
feel that Giles, too, found Ruth irritating. He could
be very sharp with her, especially when she patronized
her mother. But Ruth now, fortified by her new experience
of life and in less awe of a brother, was not to
be quelled by sharpness, so that if Giles had not withdrawn
into gloomy silences there would often have
been quarrels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no harm in her. She’s as good as gold.
She’d go to the stake for Mummy if it were necessary,
cheerfully and as a matter of course; only she’s so insufferably
conceited,” Giles grumbled to Alix in the
study. “Why didn’t you tell her she knew nothing
about it, when she was chaffing you about French
manners and customs just now? All she knows about
French manners are those of the professor’s family she
stayed with in Paris. Why didn’t you tell her to shut
up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would have been rude,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she was rude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is no reason for me,” Alix slightly smiled,
looking up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, no!” Giles, with a rueful laugh, rubbed
his hand through his hair. “Ruth’s manners could
never be a reason for yours, could they! I say, you
know, that’s a nasty one, Alix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not mean it to be nasty. And she did not
mean to be rude,” said Alix. “She meant only to be
funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes her stupid, then, as well as conceited,”
said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she took refuge with Giles, it was curious and
touching to Alix to note that before Ruth’s assaults
Mrs. Bradley more and more took refuge with her.
When Ruth, with a shout of laughter, crowed “Victorian!”
at her mother, Alix begged that the inferiority
of this term should be explained to her. “For
in Maman’s salon,” she observed, “clever people—I
mean the ones your clever people quarrel over in the
reviews as to who should claim to have first read them—admire
even George Eliot and Ruskin, I assure you.
Admire them greatly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Help!” shrieked Ruth. She knew nothing
of the clever people in Maman’s salon. She had not
advanced to the recognition of cleverness beyond her
reach; she had advanced only as far as scorn for unfashionable
tastes, and in herself, as Alix, musing on
her, perceived, she had none of the stuff from which
new valuations are made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you know,” Mrs. Bradley, for the sake of historical
accuracy put forward—evading by the mere
force of her impersonality any altercation—“it wasn’t
really so long ago when I was young, Ruth. I didn’t
live in the time of crinolines. I was reading my Dostoievsky
in French and my Hardy in English when I
was your age, and I don’t seem to see that you young
people have got beyond them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mummy darling, it’s not a question of what
you read or don’t read!” cried Ruth, affectionately
ruffling her mother’s head. “It’s the colour of your
mind! It’s the pattern of your complexes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some truth in that, you know,” Mrs.
Bradley observed to Alix when, after this sally, Ruth
seized her hockey stick and strode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley always saw whatever of truth there
was to be seen in other people’s positions. She felt no
impatience or grievance against her merciless daughter.
She had not time for such reactions. Her own work
occupied all her time. And she hoped for her children
that they, too, would find work that would thus become
the meaning of their lives. It was wonderful in
her, this detachment, Alix thought, yet she found fault
with it, and it was the only fault she found in Mrs.
Bradley. She should have felt herself more responsible
for the uncouthness of her daughter; she should have
given less thought to the welfare of the London children,
and more to the manners of her own. “It would
have been better for them,” thought Alix, “if she
could have become very angry with them. How excellent
for Ruth and Rosemary if they could have been
well whipped from time to time. And it is too late
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley would have thought whipping irrational
and cruel. “She is too wise, too quiet,” thought Alix.
“But then the saints were like that; wise and quiet and
incapable of anger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had never cared at all about the saints, and it
was strange to feel that this heretic lady, creedless and
uncloistered, made them more real and more lovable to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think so, too, Giles?” she said to her
friend in the study. “Do you not see what I mean?
She is like a modern kind of saint; so selfless and dedicated
and laborious. She never thinks about being
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make her happy, Alix. Did you know that?”
said Giles.—“Yes, I see perfectly what you mean.
Yet Mummy never seems to me sad. Does she to
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” Alix reflected. “She did not begin
so quiet, I am sure. Just as the saints did not. At the
bottom of her heart she wanted to be loved more; much
more;—isn’t that what all people want most, Giles?—And
then when she found that she was not to be she
must have felt very sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, I say, you know!”—Giles stared at her from
his chair. “You do say the most astonishing things!
Not loved enough! Why don’t we all love her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but it would have to be more than that. She
would want far more love than English children could
ever give to their parents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English children! Surely you don’t think that the
French love their parents more than we do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course we do, Giles,” said Alix in candid surprise.
“Our mothers we do; for perhaps fathers do not
count for so much with us, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, I can’t swallow that.” Giles smiling,
yet disturbed, was rubbing his hand over his hair.
“You—even you—don’t love your mother more
than I do mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I do, Giles. I think we are more a part of
our mothers in France. You stand more alone in England,
in everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles in his disturbance of mind had got up and was
looking out of the window. “And what about my
father, then?” he said. “What about his love for her?
That’s what we think of in England as counting most
in a woman’s life. He was devoted to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix felt a little shy of sharing with Giles her deepest
intuition about Mrs. Bradley’s selflessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid not enough, Giles. Did he really see
her as you see her? I am afraid he was not a part of
herself, and that is what one expects in England and
that is why she must have been sad. And I think she
loved best always—if you do not mind my saying so—the
ones who were most part of herself—you and
Captain Owen and Francis. One cannot help loving
most people who are most part of oneself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And though she still kept her French scepticism
about marriage, the half-unconscious climax of a long
process of change within Alix was reached when she
added in her own thought: “How sad to be married to
someone who is not part of yourself.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the last fortnight of the holidays that a letter,
once more, came from Lady Mary asking, as if only
a few weeks had elapsed since the last time of asking,
if Alix could not now come and stay with them at
Cresswell Abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter was again addressed to Mrs. Bradley and
again arrived at breakfast-time so that she read it
aloud to the assembled family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to go this time, Alix,” said Giles, with
an air of fatherly authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the ‘have’ about it, Giles?” Ruth inquired,
helping herself to mustard with her kedgeree.
“She’ll go if she likes, I suppose; and not otherwise.
For my part I don’t see why she should be at the beck
and call of Lady Hamble, or whatever her name is.
She’s forgotten Alix for long enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s to the point is that she’s remembered her
for long enough,” said Giles, “and that Alix has remembered
her. Of course, you’re going, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix will be bored stiff among all those swells,”
cried Rosemary; “and, besides, she’ll miss the Eustaces’
dance. Do refuse, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do not think they will bore me,” said Alix.
“I should like to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was arranged that Giles was to motor her to
Hampshire; the cross-country journey was too difficult
by train, and while the map was brought and
spread out over the jam-pots and butter-dishes and
they all made suggestions as to the best route, Alix
had time to wonder why, despite her assertion, her old
eagerness about Cresswell Abbey and Lady Mary was
much faded. Was it that she had grown fonder of
Heathside? Yes; undoubtedly; but that was not the
reason. It was not to lose Heathside to pay Cresswell
Abbey a visit. But, with a new, unwonted shyness,
she shrank from the thought of the environment that
had, in Lady Mary herself, so reminded her of Maman.
Maman would want her to go. She would want it
more than Giles did; and did he not want it because he
knew that it would be Maman’s desire for her? It was
almost to suspect them of planning it for her and it
affected her with almost a sense of grief to see his dark
head bent above Ruth’s golden one while, so earnestly,
he scanned the road that was to lead her away from
them. Did he—with Maman to help him—believe
that it would lead to an English marriage for her? The
blood rose faintly in her cheeks as she sat there, silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her disquiet was even deeper than this. She had
no longer her old sense of security. It was Giles’s
presence that lent her what security she had and he
would not be at Cresswell Abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very silent on the morning they set out for
their long drive. It was nearly mid-day, yet the hoar
frost still made the woods thick and white against the
sky, and the twigs were like antlers in their mossy
branching outlines. When they passed into the open
country the buffs and cinnamons and mole-colours of
the fields and uplands were all powdered to paleness.
The beauty of the day was like a promise, but Alix
felt it like a farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be back in the fortnight at most, you know,”
said Giles. He saw that she was sad and said it to reassure
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course I shall not stay for a fortnight, Giles,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Mary didn’t fix any time; but I do hope you’ll
stay for as long as she asks you,” Giles returned. She
made no reply. That, of course, was what Maman
would wish him to say to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the way longer than they had computed,
and Alix was very hungry by the time they reached
the little market-town where they were to lunch. It
was disappointing to find the mutton so tough, and the
untidy and decorated young person who waited on
them brought the cabbage and potatoes with such a
languid mien that they seemed to be almost a concession
to special greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the cooks in your provincial inns have no
pride in their calling,” Alix observed, refraining from a
very yellow custard pudding while Giles doggedly attacked
bread and cheese. “It is a pity; for pride in
one’s calling gives a zest to life, does it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, Alix! Don’t rub it in!” Giles exclaimed,
for the mutton had been very tough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was already four o’clock when they entered the
lodge gates of Cresswell Abbey. The road through the
park wound upwards and one saw the ample, happy
house with the dropping sun yellowing its windows as
it looked out over a southern aspect. Built of pale grey
stone and thickly lichened with rosettes of gold, it
belonged to an England almost intimate still in its associations.
A Gainsborough lady, when it was but newly
built, might, Alix thought, have come strolling out
on the terrace, the white fur of her little silk jacket
turned up about her ears, and a white dog, half
Spitz, half Pomeranian, trotting by her side. There
was nothing of the splendour or romance of antiquity
about it, and Alix, as she saw it, a vision of haughty
Montarel hovering at the back of her mind, was a little
disappointed. But it was impossible to think of English
people living at Montarel. How different this
kind-eyed butler from Mélanie in her <span class='it'>savates</span>; how
different the firelit hall, filled with the scent of pot-pourri
and burning logs, from the gaunt cobwebby
spaces of Montarel! A wide staircase turned to an
upper landing from the hall, and on the turn, with
an ascending row of Chinese paintings behind him,
a young man in hunting-dress was standing, looking
down at them, as they were ushered in, with soft,
bright, interested eyes. A group of people, half shut
in by a high Chinese screen of red and gold, sat round
the fire and from an open door came the sound of a
piano playing a reckless jazz tune. Alix felt her sadness
dispelled by a sweet stealing sense of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Lady Mary was again before her, looking
older than she had remembered her—and that was
perhaps because another woman, radiantly young, sat
knitting by the fire—but showing the remembered
bright softness, and she was drawing them both forward
and saying to Giles: “Oh, but of course you
must stay—oh, not only to tea; for the night. It’s so
far. It’s so cold. It’s so late. Indeed, you must.—Jerry
will lend you everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry came down the stairs. He had auburn hair and
auburn eyes and thick upturned auburn lashes. He
was, of course, Lady Mary’s son, and Alix was aware
that during this little interval it had been at herself
that he had been looking. She saw herself standing
there as he must see her. The soft little grey travelling-hat
came down over her eyebrows; the big, soft
collar of her coat went up about her ears; there was not
much of her face to be seen; but, for perhaps the first
time in her young life, she knew—and the knowledge,
mingling with the warm scent of the pot-pourri, the
lurching, imbecile gaiety of the music, deepened her
sense of excitement—that she held herself beautifully,
and that as far as clothes were concerned she had no
cause for disquiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am dark and she is fair,” this was the thought
that passed through her mind as she felt herself observed
not only by Jerry, but also by the radiant lady
at the fireside; “but I am even younger than she is,
and, I imagine, more unusual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>do</span> stay,” said Jerry, looking now at Giles and
smiling as if he were specially glad to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor dear Giles! How gaunt and shabby and shy he
looked among them all; rather, thought Alix, like a
rook softly entreated by a flock of doves. They cooed
about him; Lady Mary with her soft dark eyes, and
Jerry, and a kind elderly gentleman who had advanced
from the hearth, the “Times” held behind him, and
who, apparently, was Lady Mary’s husband. Even
the butler seemed to be one of the flock, and he
gently withdrew Giles’s greatcoat and carried it away
as if the question were settled before Giles had had
time, as she knew, to gather his wits together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>will</span>. That’s splendid,” said Jerry, though
Giles had not said that he would. “Let’s have tea at
once, Mummy; they’ll want it as much as I do, and
I’ll change after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary, taking Alix by the hand, as though she
might feel, as a foreigner, strange in a strange country,
led her upstairs to a bright sweet room where rose-clotted
chintzes were drawn back from the bed and
windows and flowers stood on the writing- and dressing-tables
and enticing bottles with little labels round
their necks on the wash-hand stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Debenham will get you everything. Ask her for
anything you want,” said Lady Mary, introducing the
elderly maid who entered with hot water. “You can
find your way down? We’re having tea in the drawing-room,
just out of the hall. And then you must have
a little rest. Some young people are coming over after
dinner to dance. Are you fond of dancing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fonder than of anything, I think,” said Alix; and
Lady Mary, smiling, said “Good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was left alone and had taken off her hat
and washed, and combed her hair, Alix stood before the
glass and looked at herself attentively. She looked
well after the long drive. It had not been really cold,
though her lips were a little pale. She bit them to
make the colour come, and wondered, bending closer,
whether she should powder her face. She had never yet
used the box of powder, <span class='it'>teinte Rachel</span>, in her dressing-case,
though Maman had told her that she might
do so if she thought it advisable. The radiant lady
used liquid powder; Alix had seen that at once, and her
lips were reddened artificially. Alix decided that she
would leave herself alone. “It goes better with my
hair; one colour all over like that; and the right colour,”
she reflected, while the spicy elation ran still more
warmly through her veins. Maman had chosen with
her, at a specially favourite little shop in the rue du
Faubourg Saint-Honoré, the jumper of palest blue and
grey, patterned like a fritillary; and the string of dull
brown beads and the blue skirt and the grey shoes and
stockings all went perfectly with it. “I am <span class='it'>bien; très
bien</span>,” she thought; and as she went down the passage
and crossed the landing and looked down into the firelit
hall with its flowers and screens and great blazing
logs, she felt herself so strangely Maman’s child. It
was as if she knew, for the first time in her life, an elation
that Maman had often felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all in the drawing-room where tea was
being laid, Jerry and Lady Mary and Mr. Hamble,
and two young girls and a young man and an old-young
man, who had evidently been dancing and who
wished to seem much younger than he was.—“I will
avoid dancing with him,” thought Alix. “He is too
stout and he brushes his hair up over his head from behind
so that it shall not be seen how bald he is.”—And
the radiant lady was talking to Giles. Giles stood
with her before the fire and looked dreadfully cross,
and that was because he did not like her. But other
people liked her; a great deal. Her soft locks, now
smooth, now clustering, were of the purest gold and
her eyes of a marvellous blue, and she, too, was undoubtedly
<span class='it'>bien, très bien</span>, in her white silk jumper and
her white woollen skirt and string of pearls. But Giles
did not like her. And she did not like Giles, either,
though she was pretending to carry on the kindest of
conversations with a dull young man, and when Jerry
came up to Alix herself the golden-haired lady, smiling
more sweetly than ever upon Giles, saw everything
that passed between them and was not pleased. She
did not care a rap about Giles. What she cared about
was Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was characteristic of Alix that the more she saw
and felt, the more silent and aloof did she become. It
might have been a fundamental racial caution in her
blood; the instinct for being sure, first, where you were,
and, second, sure of where you wished to be seen as
being before you made a movement; and as she felt the
pressure of all these strange new realizations—strangest
of all about herself—she knew that she possessed
reserves of courteous convention more than adequate
for any contingencies that might arise at Cresswell
Abbey. Quietly smiling at Jerry, she took the place
Lady Mary indicated to her beside her on the sofa and
saw that the golden-haired lady still watched her while
pretending not to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young girls were guests. They had very
sweet voices that did not mean much. One of them
was pretty, and the stout gentleman with the hair
brushed over his baldness jested with her in a low
voice, but, though he tried so to please her, the pretty
girl, while she ate a great many cakes, looked at him
with eyes that did not find him amusing. Alix felt
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Jack,” said the radiant lady, looking up from
a letter; the butler had just brought in the letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What news of Jack?” asked Mr. Hamble. The
golden-haired lady was married to his nephew and her
name was Marigold. Jack, it seemed, was rather enjoying
his job at Singapore. He wrote a long letter,
and Mrs. Hamble’s marvellous eyes became very wistful
while she read, but Alix felt sure that if she had been
reading alone in her own room they would not have
looked like that; hard and indifferent rather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, don’t be so silly,” said the other girl to
the young man who was short and robust with a tanned
jolly face. He was a sailor, and Alix liked his face and
felt that with him she would like to dance. They all
knew each other very well and laughed and talked and
she felt they saw her as a very young school-girl, for
Jerry was now talking to Giles about Oxford, and no
one paid any attention to her until Lady Mary began
to ask her about Normandy and then about Beauvais
and Rouen and so on to Chartres, on which the bald
man, whose name was Mr. Fulham and who wrote
books, as if observing her for the first time, asked her
if she knew his friends the marquis and marquise de
Tréville in Normandy and, when she said she did not,
turned to the pretty girl again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After tea she found herself alone for a little while
with Giles. She felt as if they met after long separation,
so completely had the morning’s sadness dissolved in
the pervading sense of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it here very much, don’t you?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a jolly place,” said Giles. “And they’re all so
nice. I’m glad you like it. I’m glad you’ll be happy
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles no longer looked cross, but he looked thoughtful,
and his eyes turned on her once or twice in a
way that made her wonder, with a vague discomfort,
whether he guessed at her excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you were staying here, too, Giles,” she said.
But this was not quite true. She would be sorry to see
Giles go; even a little frightened; yet if that sense of
excitement were to environ her more closely she would
not care to have Giles observing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I don’t belong here at all,” said Giles,
stretching up his arms and locking his hands behind
his head, while his eyes still studied her. “And you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you belong here?” she asked. But she
knew. He was a rook among the doves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t done any of the things they do;—or
very few of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you have; far more. Anyway, you’re fitted
for them and I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean you look down upon them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. But one has only time for so much
in one’s life and my line is taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philosophy and the Banbury Road,” said Alix,
rather sadly musing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; philosophy, though not necessarily the Banbury
Road,” said Giles. “And tutoring and being poor.
You couldn’t combine those with dances and hunting;
even if you had the choice; which I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Mary cares for the things you do, Giles.
Books and music, and the country. I believe they all
care. I think you would be quite happy with her and
Mr. Hamble and Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’d manage for a week-end now and then, no
doubt. He’s a nice boy that Jerry,” Giles added, moving
his arms now, putting his hands in his pockets and
looking with detachment at the foot crossed on his
knee. “Lucky we’re the same size, isn’t it? I shan’t
look too much of an ass in his evening things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is very nice, I think,” said Alix. “I do not care
much for Joan and Patience Wagstaffe, they seem to
me rather <span class='it'>nulle</span>. But the sailor is nice, too, and Mr.
Hamble is so kind. He told me that he would teach me
to play billiards. They seem to find that Mr. Fulham
very clever, but I would not have him however clever
he was. I do not like him. He has a sly face and eats
too much. And is Mrs. Hamble nice, Giles?” Thus
circuitously Alix approached her object. “She is exceedingly
pretty. You had a long talk with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I didn’t.” Giles laughed suddenly. “She
wasn’t talking with me—only at me; to see what she’d
catch as a rebound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, it was always delightful to get back to
Giles. After all, no one understood quite as well as
Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was she trying to catch?” Alix asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just who we were, and what we were doing
here, and why in the dickens you weren’t just the quiet
little French girl she’d expected. The funny part of it
was,” said Giles, smiling broadly as he thought of it,
“she didn’t know a bit that I saw what she was after.
Silly ass; thinking herself so gracefully concealed and
all the time as gross and as glaring as possible. She’s
stupid all right,” said Giles. “Though I daresay it
makes one stupid to imagine one’s dealing with a negligible
noodle. You let her alone, Alix. She’s a cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was very pleasant to Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a false face,” she observed. “I shall certainly
let her alone; for she displeased me from the
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Lady Mary came back and sat down and
talked with them, of France again, and of Oxford, and
Professor Cockburn, and then Jerry, having changed
his hunting-clothes for homespun, came and carried
Giles off to billiards, but Lady Mary said she would
keep Alix with her, and, when the two young men were
gone, said: “How dear he is, your Giles; such a delightful
solid mind,” so that Alix flushed with pleasure. She
was glad to have Giles appreciated and it made her
fonder of Lady Mary that she should appreciate him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary then questioned her about Giles and his
family and how she had come to know them, and Alix,
replying, felt herself move along the surfaces prepared
for her by Giles and Maman. She told Lady Mary
about Captain Owen and how great a friend he had
been and of how he had wished her to know his family.
There was nothing else to tell. Lady Mary knew just
what Mrs. Bradley knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad to rest for a little while before dinner,
lying in her room on the sofa with a soft cushion
under her head and the firelight softly glowing on her
closed eyelids, until it was time to dress. Debenham
had laid out on the bed the very dress she herself
would have chosen; her prettiest dress, of white and
crystal; and the sense of elation and excitement
mounted in her with thick swift strokes, as of rising
wings, while, before the mirror, Debenham fastened
it for her. Debenham thought her beautiful. Her
quiet, sagacious face, glancing at the reflected figure,
told Alix that she thought so; and Debenham had
seen many pretty young ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was left alone, she stood and looked at
herself. Yes; was it true. Beautiful that little head;
beautiful the long, splendid throat, the breast and
arms so white. In the tilted mirror she looked like a
naiad hovering within the thin falling lines of a fountain.
Tiny crystal drops fell along her arms and flowed
from breast to hem. She moved, and liquid lines of
crystal moved with her. Her shoes were of silver and a
fillet of twisted silver and crystal bound her dark hair.
“<span class='it'>Dieu que je suis belle!</span>” Alix murmured. She seemed
to float on a sense of buoyant power. She had never
known such happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all thought her beautiful. She saw that as she
came among them. Jerry was there—he was the first
she saw, looking at her; and the young sailor looked;
and kind Mr. Hamble; Marigold Hamble in pink and
diamonds looked, too, very hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lovely dress! Paris, of course,” said Lady
Mary, smiling at her as though she were grateful to her
for placing an object so decorative in her drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paris and Maman,” Alix smiled, and the memory
of Maman rushed over her almost with a smart of
tears. She owed it all to Maman, this transfiguration.
She was not really so beautiful, by daylight. It was
Maman’s magic that enveloped her, and Maman was
not here to see her in it. It was cruel that a stranger,
Lady Mary, should garner Maman’s sheaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw now that Giles’s large eyes were dwelling
upon her from a distance; but they were not like the
other eyes. They kept their look of thoughtfulness.
He was not seeing her in the magic. He was only seeing
her as herself. It would always be only oneself that
Giles would see. From within her fountain of happiness
she glimmered a little smile over to him—for
Jerry was beside her saying that he was to take her in
to dinner—and in Giles’s answering smile she read
something touched and gentle. She was glad that it
should be so, for Giles might have looked gloomily at
her, seeing her so happy at being beautiful; but he was
only touched; and those gentle eyes of Giles’s seemed
at once to quiet the excitement and to reassure her, as
though he said: “But of course you must be happy,
dear kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long table in the dining-room, shining under the
candles, was like a lake of bright water all drifted over
with floating knots of flowers. Everything made her
think of gliding, falling water to-night; everything was
beautiful. Jerry was beside her and he was used to
beautiful people. He saw them every day of his life.
He was like André de Valenbois in that. Giles’s very
thoughts about André crossed her mind as she turned
her eyes on the charming face beside her. He, too, was
a person removed from the earthy, primitive aspects
of life; he, too, had only had, always, to choose what
he would have and never to have what he did not
choose. And now—she felt it falling around her, cool
and refreshing as the sense of crystal drops—it was
herself he chose rather than Mrs. Hamble. He did not
look at Mrs. Hamble. He talked and talked, trying to
find out about her all the things that interested him;
her tastes, her prejudices, the colour of her personality.
He talked happily, eagerly, with something of the
ardour of a little boy playing at gardening; that was
the simile that came to Alix while she smiled quietly
at him—a little boy who gathers up armfuls of flowers
and thistles, the lovely and the commonplace together,
and brings them for admiration:—“<span class='it'>Beautiful</span>,
isn’t it?” was what he said continually; and he did not
see that there were thistles. He was younger than
André; much younger. She was dimly glad of that, for
something in the likeness she had felt disquieted her.
She liked him better than André, though he had not
André’s fine discrimination. His admirations lay
along the paths of fashion, and the fact that fashion
prided itself on being a pioneer led him into ardours
for the new and the strange soon discarded for the
newer and the stranger. He had an air, Alix saw,
of caring, immensely, that you should sympathize
with him about the latest painter, the latest poet,
the latest composer. He did not really care whether
you sympathized or not; but if you didn’t, you
were negligible for his purposes. She saw that he had
already found Giles negligible; and she wondered
why he did not put her into the same category. Did he
imagine that she possessed and withheld even fresher
appraisals? It was not so and she did not pretend it,
looking at him with her quiet smile and softly shaking
her head now and then. She had never thought of
herself as a person whose appraisals mattered; she had
thought of herself as too much of a child. But perhaps
it was because Jerry found her beautiful that he was
indifferent to her indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner they danced. Many young people arrived
and the tall red Chinese screens in the hall were
put back. There was a piano and two violins and one
of the young men who played had such a gloomy face,
like a French or Italian face—like Jules’ face—that
Alix wished she could talk to him and ask him if he
were a foreigner. But there was no time for talk. She
and Jerry found that their steps went beautifully together.
She danced with him; many times; and with
other young men; and Jerry helped her to evade Mr.
Fulham who, seeing how many partners she had,
wished to be one of them. But with Jerry it was best
of all, and how much more important it was to have
steps that chimed than to care about the same books
and pictures! It seemed to-night, among the flowers,
and lights, and music, the most important of all things;
though once or twice, when she found Giles’s eyes
again, she knew that the sense of ecstasy on which she
floated must have the evanescence of a mirage. Dear
Giles. She made him dance with her and they laughed
together as they went slowly round the hall, for Giles
did not dance well. Afterwards she saw that he talked
with Lady Mary and with Mr. Hamble. He did not
go into the mirage. He only looked on at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Alix fell asleep that night in the firelight, she
dreamed that a cool crystal stream flowed round her
and that she floated on its silver surfaces. Golden
lights lay like a chain of little suns along its margin
and her hands, softly moving in the current, felt rosy
petals pass between their fingers. The throb of dance-music,
sweet, reckless, imbecile, beat in her blood, and
in her ears the sound of Jerry’s voice saying: “<span class='it'>Beautiful</span>,
isn’t it?” And Giles’s eyes were there watching
her. In her dream she wanted to tell Giles that she had
nothing to conceal. She tried to tell him, but she felt
the silver stream flowing over her lips and making
them dumb, though they smiled. If Giles looked at
her like that she might begin to blush. But even so
she did not want him gone. While he was there she
was so safe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will see that Blaise is happy until I come
back, Giles?” said Alix, as she stood beside the car next
morning to say good-bye. “And you will write to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t time for many letters, you know,”
Giles smiled reassuringly. “I’ll see to Blaise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give my love to them all,” said Alix. The car was
beginning slowly to slide away and she went beside it.
She was not unhappy; not sad; it was only that she was
a little frightened to see Giles go. If one night had
changed so much in herself, what changes might not
one week bring? She almost felt she loved Ruth and
Rosemary this morning. Whatever their deficiencies
they had not false faces. It was true that they could
not, even if they had wished to, have concealed themselves
gracefully; but it would never occur to them to
wish to be concealed; gracefully or otherwise. Neither
were they insipid like the two Wagstaffe girls. If Ruth
and Rosemary were like roast mutton, the Wagstaffes,
Alix reflected, were like <span class='it'>fondants</span>. She stood gazing
after Giles for a moment as he disappeared among the
beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry and his mother stood on the step above her,
having come out with her to say good-bye. Lady Mary
was looking at her, a little, she felt, as Giles had looked
at her last night; thoughtfully, with great kindness in
the thoughtfulness; seeing her as herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’re going to let me teach you how to ride,”
said Jerry. “Mummy has a habit for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old one of mine. I don’t ride any longer,” said
Lady Mary, putting her hand on Alix’s shoulder as
they went into the warm sweet house. “I think it will
fit you beautifully. You and I are rather of the same
build, aren’t we, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix’s shoulders are broader than yours, Mummy,”
said Jerry, “and I’m afraid, darling, that her legs are a
little longer. She’s rather like a Jean Goujon nymph
and you are just a lovely mortal size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was odd, Alix thought, to have a young man define
the length of one’s legs; but not <span class='it'>mal élevé</span>, as it would
have been in France. Jerry discussed the physical attributes
of his friends as he would have discussed
their moral qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The habit may be a trifle too short, it’s true,” said
Lady Mary; “but that makes no difference. The Jean
Goujon nymph will be able to get into it. We must
dress Alix in the Gainsborough Blue Boy clothes one
day, Jerry, to show off her long legs. We must have a
little fancy-dress ball in the Easter holidays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I’m afraid I cannot be here in the Easter
holidays,” said Alix. “You see, those are Giles’s holidays,
too. I should miss him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be coming here off and on, I hope;—and
Giles will, too, perhaps,” smiled Lady Mary. “I can
always send the car for you. Where’s Marigold, Jerry?
Not up yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, she looks rather like the Blue Boy,
doesn’t she?” said Jerry. “Only his eyes aren’t blue,
and he has a gentler face. Alix’s face is rather <span class='it'>farouche</span>;—is
that the word?—You frighten me a little, Alix,
with those cold blue eyes of yours.—Marigold’s still in
bed. She sent for me to see her just now. Writing letters,”
said Jerry, “in a most adorable little cap; a
Watteau little cap; most frightfully becoming. That
was why she sent for me, of course, so that I should see
her in it; though the alleged motive was the Fairlies’
ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naughty Jerry,” smiled his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit naughty. I told her I saw through her. I
told her that the cap was a brilliant success. Nothing
<span class='it'>souterrain</span> about me.—Eh, Alix? Is that right?” They
all called her Alix;—as if she had been ten years old;
or as if they had always known her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you must try to talk a little French with
Alix,” said Lady Mary. “His accent is good, isn’t it?
But his verbs and genders are dreadful, and <span class='it'>souterrain</span>
isn’t right, my dear boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think Marigold quite extraordinarily
beautiful?” Jerry inquired. “Isn’t the colour of her
hair and eyes a Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale
colour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she is much more like a Watteau than like a
fairy-tale,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Watteau people are fairy-tale people.—You
mean she’s an artificial fairy-tale.—Yes, I see what
you mean.—And it’s really more Fragonard than
Watteau, too—‘A dainty rogue in porcelain,’ that’s
what she is. Do you read Meredith? I love him, though
I know he is <span class='it'>démodé</span> just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alix had not read Meredith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, when Jerry had lightly hoisted
her to the saddle and the groom had released the
chestnut’s eager head, Alix felt as if, at last, she had
discovered her true vocation. This—yes, even more
than dancing—was what she had been made for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not feel that she had anything to learn. She
felt no fear. Her hands went easily where Jerry told
her to put them; her knee and foot found their security.
Nothing this delicious creature could do, moving with
satin ease and steel strength beneath her, would take
her unawares. She understood him, and he, his gentle
ears quivering at the sound of her voice, understood
her. “Yes; yes, I see,” she said, as Jerry gave his explanations.
“Yes, we will walk to the end so that I
shall be quite used to it and then canter on the turf.
Yes; I understand; holding with my knee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not swimming, or dancing, or flying, but it
combined the delights of all three. One floated, buoyantly
sustained; one embodied the beauty of rhythmic
movement; one glided at a height strange enough for a
sense of slight, delicious trembling. The earth was new,
seen from this height; one looked into the branches of
the beeches at the level where the chaffinches were
perching and flitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sit as if you were born to it,” Jerry told her,
and she replied that her father had been a great horseman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the canter. It surprised her a little. For
one surging moment, cheeks hot, lips closed fast, she
felt that she was coming off and then, suddenly, that
nothing could bring her off. Between that fast-held
knee and that supple foot, she was poised in safety.
Her mind and body adjusted themselves to the sense of
mastered peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” Jerry smiled at her when they drew
rein at the end of the long upland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below them the country fell away in rippled planes
of colour, like a tapestry, russet, silver and blue. Alix
seemed to see it threaded with ladies riding unicorns
and wearing high white hennins. Fragments of song
rang in her mind; the joyous melancholy of <span class='it'>Les Filles
de la Rochelle</span>, the blissful sadness of <span class='it'>L’Amour de moi</span>.
Riding brought such memories crowding to one’s mind.
This was a better intoxication than the dancing mirage.
It went deeper. It set the bells of all the buried Atlantises
of the soul ringing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you thinking about <span class='it'>now</span>!” she heard
Jerry ask. She had almost forgotten Jerry while she
gazed and listened;—far away in France; in an old, old
France. But it was part of the better happiness to find
Jerry again and to feel herself again a child, with Jerry
her comrade. Mrs. Hamble was as remote as a lady on
a unicorn. The woman’s happiness of the night before,
made up of power and conquest, faded before the
child’s mere joyousness. Jerry made her think of the
chestnut horse she rode, with his eager russet head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do so like riding, Jerry!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d soon be able to hunt, if you get on like this.
How I wish I could take you out hunting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not care to hunt,” said Alix. “This is
what I like. Riding in a beautiful country with everything
happy around one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But everything is happy around you when you
hunt,” said Jerry. “Hounds and horses and people.
One is part of an immense shaded joy. And one never
sees how beautiful a country is until one has ridden
right across it and known that at every wall one might
break one’s neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like this better,” said Alix. “This is like riding
with a flower in one’s hand, and that would be to ride
with a knife between one’s teeth.—Though I understand
the pleasure of the danger.—But the fox
would spoil it all for me. He would not be part of the
immense joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I assure you—he enjoys it, too, in his own
sharp way. Imagine his joy when he outwits us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A terrible joy,” said Alix. “There must always be
terror in his blood. No; I could not bear to feel that he
was there, with his straining heart, before us. I could
never hunt. But I should like to ride for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they got back they went to find Lady Mary
in the morning-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix is a marvel, Mummy!” Jerry exclaimed.
“She’s not afraid of anything, and rides as if she’d
been born in the saddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid once,” said Alix. “When we started
to canter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary sat at her writing-bureau, photographs
and flowers ranged about her, and smiling at them
both she said: “You must come and tell me all about
it, Alix, when you’ve had your bath. Will you? I shall
be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I must do some reading,” said Jerry. “<span class='it'>Au
revoir</span>, Alix. Billiards after lunch, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary had finished her morning tasks when
Alix returned and was sitting near the fire with a little
table before her on which she was laying out tiny
patience cards. Alix again thought of a lady in a hennin
as she saw her there in her long, grey, fur-bordered
robe; a hennin would have been so becoming to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curl up in the big chair,” she said. “You must be
tired, and you’ll find yourself very stiff by to-morrow.
Do you smoke? Not yet? Good. I’m glad not. Joan
and Patience both do already, and I’m sure it’s bad
for them. That’s all their life it seems to me; smoking
and dancing. Have you many girls in France like that?
I haven’t stayed in France for so many years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not be allowed to smoke; not until I married,
I think,” said Alix, leaning her head on the side
of the big chair and watching her hostess’s white hands
place the little cards. “I don’t know about other girls.
But I do not think that they have as much liberty as
in England. I like liberty; but not for so many cigarettes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt very much at home with Lady Mary, who
continued to make her think of Maman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liberty for the right things and not for the foolish
things,” smiled Lady Mary. “And it’s a pity to have
liberty for foolish things even when one marries. Tell
me where you and Jerry went. Across the ridge and
down to Minching’s Pond? A wonderful place that is
for birds in Spring—Three Oaks Corner; yes; only
the oaks went during the war. Did Jerry tell you?
Dreadful to see the empty places. And as far as the
Mill. That was a splendid round. Ah, I felt sure you’d
like Darcy. Isn’t he a lamb of a horse! Jerry wanted
you to have Darcy.—I’m so glad you are here to
play with Jerry,” Lady Mary went on. “Marigold is
such a flirt. She can’t help it.” Lady Mary smiled at
Alix and shuffled her cards. “She is a born siren. And
Jerry is too young for sirens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had again the sensation of being confided in
despite her youth. It was curious how quickly, if they
liked you, they confided in you, these strange English
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t answer Jerry this morning about her
looks,” Lady Mary was going on. “It’s a thin little
face, I feel, don’t you? And too pink-and-white; too
blue-and-gold. But perhaps that’s because I’m dark.
I suppose dark people, like you and me, Alix, usually
suspect the white-and-gold ones of being cats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not like her face,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereas Jerry admires her immensely; and he’s
only a boy, only just twenty, you know, and it’s rather
tiresome. You will take his mind off her.—Not that
it has ever really worried me,” said Lady Mary; and
Alix knew that it really had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jerry and his flirtation was not Lady Mary’s
object. Alix began to see that her interest in herself
was more disinterested than that. She was making her
way, through smoking, and riding, and Marigold, to
other topics. The topic she was really coming to was
Giles, and she wanted to find out just how fond Alix
was of him, and just how far went her commitments to
him and to his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix fancied, watching her, that she had a habit of
playing patience when she wanted to say special things
to you and to keep them from seeming special.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder at their taking you in as you say
they have,” she remarked, when Alix expressed her
sense of gratitude to the Bradleys. “Their brother,
you know; what you and your mother had done for
him. Giles told me about that last night.—And then
you are a nice young person in yourself, Alix. One
might like having you about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is not because I am nice that they have me,”
Alix demurred. “And even if they did not like me so
much they would take me in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Because he was so fond of me. And not even
quite that. It is more as if I had been a fox terrier he
had left behind him. I mean it was like that at the
beginning. They would have taken it in and cared for
it always, even if it had not been a very nice one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary laughed. “Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> a very nice one.
I liked Giles’s mother that day in Oxford. She is very
earnest, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she hasn’t much sense of humour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is so busy all the time,” said Alix. “When one
is so very busy taking care of people, there is not much
time for humour. But she can be quite playful; like a
young girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see her being playful,” said Lady Mary.
“Just as I can’t see her with her hair waved or her nose
powdered. I don’t suppose she’s ever powdered her
nose, or rouged her lips, or had her hair waved, has
she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not go with her type,” said Alix. “There
is a natural ripple in her hair, and her nose is of that
pale dull sort that does not need powder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary was laughing again. “She’s a dear, of
course. I saw that. And of course it isn’t her type. It
isn’t his type either, is it; the pretty surfaces of life.
Though <span class='it'>he</span> has humour,” said Lady Mary, clipping
down a card with soft deliberation and then shifting it.
“Quite grim humour, too, I felt, once or twice. And
I like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know no one who has a better sense of humour
than Giles,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is modest, too,” said Lady Mary. “And most
middle-class young men are so overweeningly proud of
their brains. We must all be proud of something, I
suppose. One rather wishes he was not going to be
buried in Oxford; but one feels, too, that it is his
<span class='it'>métier</span>. He would not care a scrap about getting on or
making a name in the world, and it’s such a happy
life, that of the scholar. And if they don’t intend to
marry, there’s no reason why they <span class='it'>should</span> strive and
strain like worldly people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then they do marry,” Alix observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. Yes; perhaps so. But it depends to whom. It
would be the unfortunate wife who would strive and
strain in that case, wouldn’t it? It must be a very
dreary life. Marigold wouldn’t like it, would she?”
laughed Lady Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they wouldn’t like her,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all depends on what you want, of course,” said
Lady Mary, holding up an undecided card. “If one
wants earnestness and an unpowdered nose, that is one
thing; and if one wants hunting and dancing and diamonds,
like Marigold, that is another. I detest worldliness,”
said Lady Mary, “but I do like common-sense.
Now your dear Giles, I could see that, has any amount
of common-sense and not a scrap of worldliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix listening, while Lady Mary thus mused, finding
his place for Giles rather as she found the place for the
hovering card, recognized still further resemblances to
Maman. Lady Mary, too, could be sweetly devious.
She would feed you with spoonfuls of honey satisfied
that you would never taste the alien powder that was
being administered. She was talking to her now as to
the clever child who could take no personal interest in
the question of marriage. But the experience was to
Alix a familiar one and the admonitory flavour at once
detected. She was not to take an interest, but Lady
Mary was taking an interest for her. Lady Mary was
selecting her place for her very much as Maman would
have done; and, as with Maman, Alix often found a
malicious pleasure in seeing through her and pretending
not to see, so now she pleased herself by saying
nothing to Lady Mary of Giles’s devotion to Toppie
which would so have set her mind at rest. “Giles is my
greatest friend,” was all she vouchsafed presently, and
Lady Mary could make of it what she chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been minor intimations gliding along beside
the major one. If Giles, in his chosen career, was
not to be thought of as a husband, Heathside and the
Bradleys need not be thought of as essential to Alix’s
life in England. Not for a moment did Lady Mary
intimate anything so gross as that Alix should abandon
her friends; she only made it clear that, since she
could now count on new ones, she was not dependent
on Heathside. They were very strange, these English
people, Alix meditated, her dark head leaning back in
the chair, her blue eyes resting with their Alpine aloofness
on her hostess. How much, if they once liked you,
they took you for granted; and how very easily, so it
seemed to Alix, they did like you. Lady Mary resembled
Giles in that; and Toppie and Mrs. Bradley;
and if they swallowed you down, asking no questions,
was it because they were so extraordinarily kind, or
because they were so sure of themselves and of their
conditions that they could not conceive of your doing
them any harm? The difference—how often Alix had
meditated these differences—was that the French
were so sure of themselves and of their conditions that
they couldn’t conceive of your doing them any good.
The English, certainly, were more kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But were they kind enough to make themselves
responsible for you? Giles would. Alix had seen Giles
make himself responsible. She believed that Toppie
would; and Mrs. Bradley. Even Ruth and Rosemary,
if the test came, would, she believed, shoulder her.
But strangely, painfully—for she, too, liked Lady
Mary, though she did not at all take her for granted—Alix
could imagine this new friend, if consequences
proved troublesome or unpalatable, choosing, simply,
as the easiest way out, to forget all about her. She was
dove-like, but she was capricious. Her life was beautiful,
and she enjoyed laying out other people’s lives in
harmony with its beauty, making a chiming pattern of
you as she did with her patience cards, because she
liked to make patterns and because she thought of
herself as able to do what she liked. But it would be
unwise to give oneself to the Lady Marys or trust them
as they invited you to trust them. They, too, were far
more implicated in the dust of human conditions than
they knew themselves to be. They did not really know
themselves, for they did not know the dust; and, where
she herself was concerned, Alix deeply suspected that
consequences might prove dusty; might prove troublesome
and unpalatable. She felt herself to be older than
Lady Mary as she watched her and listened to her; she
felt herself wiser. Life required far more circumspection
than Lady Mary imagined. If Lady Mary was
circumspect it was subconsciously, for candour was her
aim. But so one might mislead oneself and other
people. And as all these thoughts went through Alix’s
mind, while Lady Mary laid out her pretty cards, there
floated across it a memory of the shrewd old face of a
priest to whom she had once gone for the yearly, the
reluctant, confession. If one was more circumspect
than any English person, was it because of the generations
of Catholicism in one’s blood? One’s confessor
always took so many disagreeable things for granted,
about life and about human nature; and, on reflection,
one usually found that he had been right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Under pressure from Giles, who wrote that of course
she must stay on, Alix’s visit to Cresswell Abbey
lengthened itself over the whole remaining fortnight of
the holidays. She went to the Fairlies’ ball, where she
wore her white and crystal dress, and to another, where
she wore her pink with the wreath of rosebuds. She
danced and danced. In the mornings she rode with
Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How strange Heathside seemed to her when she at
last returned to it, as strange as when she had first
come to it from France. Life at Cresswell Abbey was
so much more like life at Maman’s than anything at
Heathside. Always, at Maman’s, there was that same
sense of mental grace; always the people, the varying
people, coming and going, who displayed it. The
people at Cresswell were not so graceful or so interested
in mental things; but, from the mere fact that there
were so many of them and of so many varieties, they
reminded her of the life in Paris with Maman. And
besides the young men and the young girls who danced
and played together, there were pleasant, sagacious
women, all so beautifully dressed, and their political
husbands. At Cresswell one had whom one chose to
amuse or instruct one; at Heathside one had to take
what the neighbourhood or the High School provided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough, however, she found herself, on her
return, liking not only Rosemary, her daily companion,
more than she had ever liked her, but the High School
girls, too. It was, she knew, because she had seen so
much of Marigold Hamble and because they were so
different from Marigold. Marigold had not attempted
to molest her in any way; she had, indeed, attempted
to attach her; but Alix, in regard to Marigold, had
never for a moment relaxed her circumspection, though,
in regard to Lady Mary, it was impossible not often to
relax it. She could match Marigold at empty affability,
but she could not display Marigold’s empty affectionateness,
and the more it was displayed, the more she
disliked her. If she disliked Marigold, Marigold hated
her; she knew that unerringly with her growing power
of womanly divination. Marigold hated her because
Jerry liked her so much and because she never made
an effort to attach him; while Marigold made every
effort compatible with graceful concealment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time she went away it was as if she had become
almost as much a part of the life at Cresswell as
she was part of the life at Heathside. Lady Mary was
so fond of her and depended, strangely, Alix thought,
on her taste and judgment about so many things;—and
that was like Maman, too. And Mr. Hamble was
fond of her, teaching her billiards and cracking many
cheerful jests with her at the expense of France. It was
natural, it was inevitable, that she should come back
again, and for almost all the winter week-ends she did
come back. There was always a party for the week-ends,
and sometimes Jerry motored down from Oxford
for the day, and once he stayed the night for a dance,
and Marigold, on this occasion, adopted a new and
surprising attitude towards Alix, behaving as if she had
never seen her before. She also gave scant attention to
Jerry, and Alix remarked that though Jerry did not
really like Marigold he was perturbed by her neglect;
so perturbed that he even forgot to dance with Alix
and stood watching Marigold fox-trotting with another
man, his radiance all dimmed by resentful gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor darling; isn’t he foolish?” Lady Mary commented
to her young friend, and Alix, in no need of
partners, said calmly that he was, telling herself that
she did not in the least mind what Jerry did. But she
did mind. Since the moment that she had seen his
eyes fixed upon her from the stairs she had minded,
not because she cared for Jerry, but because she cared,
intensely, that he should care for her. Was she, then,
another Marigold? She asked herself this question
fiercely, lying awake in her firelit room, her immature
young heart strained by the sense of contest between
herself and the crafty woman. Why should she mind
Jerry’s gloom? What was Jerry to her? Nothing;
nothing; the answer came to her irrefutably from the
depths of her heart where anger and pride could not
penetrate to blur the truth; Jerry was nothing more
than the charming comrade, unless Marigold was there
to take him from her. Her delight in Jerry, apart from
their comradeship, was only her delight in his delight.
She could not understand, she could not see what it
was she wanted nor what was this fire that burned
within her, but, feeling hot tears rising in her eyes, she
remembered what the old priest had said about the
wickedness of the human heart and knew again that
he was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was always a relief to get back to Rosemary.
Rosemary had not a purr in her composition, and that
was a defect; but she had not a scratch either. Even
in the High School girls, whose virtues she had felt
to be so negative, she appreciated now the positive
quality of straightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Easter holidays came, Alix found that
there was no reason why she should not go to Cresswell
for the fancy-dress ball. Giles was to be away for
a fortnight. She would not miss him in going. There
were other reasons for accepting with a mind at ease.
Marigold was safely in the Riviera and Jerry’s letter,
telling her of the fact, was very naughty, breathing as
it did an evident relief. Jerry, too, was young and his
heart, too, had been strained by the sense of pointless
contest. Eager comradeship and an assurance of peace
infused every line of his pretty dashing pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Lady Mary’s car came for her and she went off,
Rosemary teasing her from the steps and declaring
that they would all be on the lookout for her picture
in the “Daily Mail” dressed as the Blue Boy. Rosemary
was a dear, thought Alix, leaning out to smile
and have a last glance at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came ten days at Cresswell; days that altered
all her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must at once tell Giles about it; that was the
thought that filled her mind as she sat with him in
the study, on the April morning after his return
and hers. But there was so much to tell that she did
not know how she should begin, and what made it
more difficult was that Giles was very sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was in Bournemouth with her father and it
was evident from her letters that Mr. Westmacott was
dying. Although Giles had not seen her for such a long
time, it was natural that he should be thinking of
Toppie rather than of her, so that she said nothing,
and it was Giles himself who introduced her theme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you stay on at Cresswell?” he asked
her. “I saw Jerry in Oxford just before I came down,
and he evidently thought they were to keep you for a
month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I never intended that,” said Alix. “I
said I must be back here for your time at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was awfully sweet of you, my dear child,”
said Giles, who walked about, looking very tall in his
new grey tweeds. “I’m awfully glad to find you here,
of course; but you know what I feel about cake and
bread-and-butter, and I should like you to eat the full
slice. How was the Blue Boy costume? Jerry told me
about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was very pretty. I looked well in it,” said Alix.
“Our photographs were all taken. You shall see how
I looked, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you and Jerry rode a lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We rode almost every morning. I love riding,
Giles. Even more than dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Of course you do,” said Giles rather absently.
“Why shouldn’t you love it? You like Jerry as much
as ever, don’t you? You and he are great pals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix almost had to smile a little at this, it was so
transparent of Giles, though, a fortnight ago, she
would, perhaps, not have seen how transparent it was.
It made it easier for her, however, and as she answered:—“Yes.
Great pals. Yes; I like him as much as ever,”—she
raised her eyes to his and saw that he continued
to look at her as though aware of approaching confidences.
It would not be at all difficult to make confidences
to Giles. She felt him very, very much older
than herself and, if that were possible, even kinder
than before. How strange, the thought passed through
her mind;—it was easier to tell Giles than it would
have been to tell Maman. The moment had come and,
keeping her eyes on her friend, she said: “He wants
me to marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat there on the sofa in her blue fritillary jumper
and her dark beads, her hands lightly clasped around
one of the old leather cushions, a little as she might
have sat, in her early convent days, giving an account
of herself in the <span class='it'>parloir</span>—where the lives of the saints,
heavily gilded, lay symmetrically on the centre table—to
the relative who had come to pay her a weekly
visit. Decorum was in her voice and attitude; and
though she knew a sense of trembling beneath her
calm words she was sustained by her assurance of
suitability. It was suitable that she should tell Giles of
her offer of marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did not seem at all surprised. He turned to
get his pipe and filled and lighted it, first pressing down
the tobacco with his finger in the way she liked to
watch, and all this was done very deliberately before
he spoke. Then he said—could anything be easier
than to tell things to Giles—“And what do you want,
Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was very much older than she was, and very
much older than Jerry. She almost wished that Jerry
were there with her to take counsel of Giles. “You
like him, too, Giles, do you not?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>that</span> hasn’t much to do with it, has it?” Giles
returned, looking down at her with his smile. “What’s
to the point is that you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not care to like, very much, anyone you
did not like,” said Alix. “Jerry has faults. But we all
have faults. I wish you knew him better. Then you
could judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was looking at her with a sort of astonishment,
at once tender and amused. “But I’m not your father,
Alix,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the only father I have ever known,” Alix
replied, and, looking down as she said this, she felt her
eyes heavy with sudden tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, dear little Alix,”—Giles must have
seen the tears for he spoke very gently,—“since I’m
to take a father’s place, may I ask you what you said
to this young man,—this young man, whatever his
faults, whom I thought eligible in every way. Highly
eligible and altogether suitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said I could not marry in England,” said Alix,
and it was with difficulty now that she restrained her
tears, remembering her proud words to Giles about an
English marriage on the cliff-path last summer; remembering
Jerry, so bright and beautiful, and France,
brighter and more beautiful and with claims far deeper
than any Jerry could put forward. What meaning
could life have for any Frenchwoman out of France?
Did not all one’s meaning come from her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did Jerry say to that?” Giles was inquiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said I was too young. He said he would wait.
He said he could perhaps live in France for part of the
time. He did not speak very reasonably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me that he spoke very reasonably, indeed.
He can wait. And you are very young. How old
is it you are now, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be eighteen in July. Not young enough to
change as much as he expects,” said Alix. “No, he was
not reasonable, for he contradicted himself a great
deal. I am afraid he did not mean what he said. I
don’t think that he means to wait. I don’t think that
he really would live in France. Afterwards, when we
had talked a little more and he had felt that I was not
so young—he spoke very wildly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wildly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint flush rose in Alix’s cheeks. “He did not
please me in the way he behaved. It could not have
happened like that with us.—Our way, I think, is a
better way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did he behave?” Giles, after a moment, inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s flush was deepening. “He tried to embrace
me. He tried to kiss me.—As if to be embraced and
kissed would decide everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Giles’s gaze, bent upon her, she was aware of a
growing wonder. “It does decide everything, sometimes,
you know,” he offered her, as if, for the moment,
it was all that he could find to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not for people of character, Giles,” Alix returned.
She did not know from what deep tradition
she spoke; but it was behind her, around her, in her
very blood. She spoke for the order that was not there
to protect her; for the sanctions that she lacked. Great
events like marriage were approached with a certain
austerity. So much more than oneself was involved.
“It could only decide things for <span class='it'>les gens sans mœurs</span>,”
she said. “It displeased me very much that he should
seem to think of me as one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he didn’t think of you as one. We’re all like
that, in England,” said Giles, gazing at her with his
wonder. “We’re all <span class='it'>sans mœurs</span> when it comes to
things like this. We think them so much more important
than <span class='it'>mœurs</span>.—At least”—he stopped; he
reddened:—“A man in love wants to find out, you
see,” he finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To find out what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, if you care for him. If you’re in love with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it not be found out without kissing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—if you don’t care enough for a man to kiss
him—Oh, you’re right, perfectly right, Alix, dear;
for yourself you’re perfectly right. I’m lost in admiration
of your rightness. But didn’t his love touch you
at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix at this contemplated her friend in silence for
some moments. It was not the effort to be frank with
Giles that held her thoughts; she found no difficulty in
being frank with Giles; it was the effort to read herself.
And, finding the truth slowly, she said: “Yes; it
did touch me. That was my difficulty. That has been
my difficulty ever since, Giles; for I cannot feel it right.
He troubled me,” said Alix, and she added to herself,
in French, “<span class='it'>Il m’a beaucoup troublée</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles then turned away from her, putting his hands
in his pockets and going to stare out of the window, as
he had done on that long ago winter day of their first
great encounter when she had felt, without knowing
why it was, that he was thinking of her and not of
Maman. She could not see what it was this time,
either, that so moved him. Perhaps to find himself so
trusted. Yet he must have taken that for granted. If
she were not to trust Giles, who on earth was there to
trust?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat, her hands clasped on her cushion, and looked
into the gas-fire which creaked and crackled softly.
The little saucepan of water standing on it sent up a
thin haze of vapour and from the open window came
the loud singing of a chaffinch. Alix, as she listened to
the chaffinch, felt herself mastering with difficulty that
sense of tears. She was not happy. Not at all happy.
There was something delicious in the thought of Jerry
and his love; but something that twisted, dislocated
all her life. How strange was life. How near it brought
you to people; how far apart it could carry you, with
the mere speaking of a word. If she spoke the word
that Jerry had implored of her, would it not carry her
far away from Giles. Oh, there was a darker surmise.
Would it not carry her far away from Maman? Could
Maman remain near if she were to marry Jerry? Jerry
promised, promised everything. He did not know himself
at all. He was very young. He was weak; and she,
too, was young and weak, though to Jerry she had
shown only her strength. Yet she knew herself. She
could see her own weakness. “<span class='it'>Il m’a beaucoup troublée.</span>”
So much had Jerry troubled her that she had known
for a moment, his ardent eyes upon her, the fear that
she might forget Maman, France, Giles, what they
might all demand, expect of her, for the mere joy of
feeling his arms go round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles turned to her at last. “Well, then, Alix, how
did it end?” he asked her, leaning against the window-sill
and looking over at her with folded arms. “What
was decided in your way, since you wouldn’t let anything
be decided in his?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was decided,” said Alix, glad to take up her
tale, “was that he should tell his mother and father at
once. He did not want that at all. He said his parents
had nothing to do with it. He said that until he had my
answer he would tell nobody. He said that they would
think him too young, and that he would not bear interference.
It was all so wild and foolish, Giles. Our way
is so much better. But when I told him that unless
they knew his feeling for me I could not return to
Cresswell, he had to consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well. And what then? What did they say?” Giles
inquired as she paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hamble said nothing; I do not think he ever
has much to say in the <span class='it'>conseils de famille</span>. It was Lady
Mary who came to me,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she say then? Had she expected it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix lifted her eyes to her friend. “That is what I
find so strange, Giles. She had not expected it at all.
Is that not a little <span class='it'>naïf</span>, do you not think? On the one
hand to give perfect freedom, and on the other to
imagine that nothing unforeseen shall happen. If one
gives freedom, one must expect the unforeseen, must
one not?—She was very kind. She said she had
thought of me and Jerry as playmates, and that I was
right to say to him that we were far, far too young.
She was, I saw, much disturbed; but she was pleased
with me, too, and kissed me and said I had been a good,
wise child—much too good, she said, for her foolish
Jerry. I saw that I surprised her. In all I had to say
to her I surprised her. I do not know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you have to say to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All my difficulties, Giles. The difficulties about
France; how I could not leave my country; and about
Maman, how I must be near her always; that it is like
that with us; that we do not leave our mothers when
we marry. And I said that since I am a Catholic, the
children, if I married, would have to be Catholics, too.
It all surprised her very much. It pleased her, too, and
reassured her; for though she is so fond of me she would
much rather her son did not marry a French girl and a
Catholic. And she is right in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that she’s right,” Giles muttered.
“You must have surprised her very much, indeed, Alix.
It’s been left, then, as you intended to have it left?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. For the present. I told Lady Mary that
nothing could be done till she and Maman had met
and I wrote to Maman and told her of the offer of marriage.
I put only the difficulties before Maman. I am
afraid Maman will see the advantages rather than the
difficulties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The difficulties being that you cannot give up
France and cannot give up your religion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And Lady Mary may have others quite of her
own. Maman will have to face them all. But I think
she and Lady Mary will understand one another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for yourself, which do you feel the greater
difficulty, Alix;—your country or your religion? You
never strike me as having any religion at all, you know.
You always seem to me, as I told you long ago, just a
little pagan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if it were for myself,” said Alix, “I could give
up my religion more easily than my country. Only my
Church would not allow me to marry a heretic unless I
promised about the children. It is simply not allowed
with us, Giles.—Do you not know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not turn heretic yourself, and settle the
children like that?” Giles exclaimed, controlling, she
saw, a strong inclination to laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alix knew that though she was not <span class='it'>dévote</span> there
were some things deeper even than France, or were
they not the deepest things in France? They were
there, to be taken or left, as one chose; but even if she
left them they were still there, part of her heritage;
like a great landscape on which one might not care to
open one’s windows. And it was a heritage of which
one could not deprive others, whatever use one made
of it oneself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I could never do,” she said, shaking her head.
“I could not go against my Church. However much I
cared, Giles, I could never be a Protestant.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was only a few days after this interview that the
news of Mr. Westmacott’s death reached them. Toppie
spent ten days in Bath with friends before returning
to the Rectory, and it was Mrs. Bradley who went
to her first. She said, when she came back, that Toppie
wanted to see Giles and hoped that he could come to
her next morning. She wanted very much to see him.
Giles, when he had been given this message, went away
and shut himself into his study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, do you expect she’s going to have him at
last!” Ruth exclaimed. “For my part I believe she is,
and a good job, too. Giles may be able to wake her up
a bit. I find Toppie distinctly depressing myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Giles,” said Rosemary, “it made him
look most awfully queer. It’ll be a shame if she doesn’t
have him now, after the way he’s waited.—If she
doesn’t have him, where do you suppose she’ll live?
There’s that jolly cottage on the common empty. It
would just do for her; with an old aunt to live with
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she doesn’t have him,” said Ruth sagaciously,
“my own feeling is that she’ll go away as far as possible.
None of us, except perhaps Mummy, have ever meant
anything to her. She’s not got much heart, if you ask
my opinion. Or, at all events, only heart enough for
one person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you find her?” Alix asked Mrs. Bradley
when they were left alone. “She will be too unhappy
now, so soon after her father’s death, to think of Giles.
But for the future, is there hope did you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know what to think, dear,” said Mrs.
Bradley, taking off her hat and putting up her hand,
with a gesture so like Giles, to push back her hair.
“Toppie is rather strange. That is what I feel most.
She doesn’t seem unhappy. Not more unhappy than
she’s always been, I mean. She talked about Owen all
the time. She said she had never felt him so near.
That doesn’t look very hopeful for Giles, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She might say that just because she was really
turning a little towards Giles. One might hope that
it would work like that in her, perhaps,” said Alix,
though she had not indeed much hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Mrs. Bradley sadly. “But haven’t
you felt for a long time that something has come between
Toppie and Giles? Since last Autumn I’ve felt
it. I believe, when she came back from Bournemouth,
he asked her, and that it displeased her and made her
draw away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I believe, too, that it was like that,” said Alix.
“I have felt her changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know there’s something in what Ruth says,”
Mrs. Bradley went on after a moment. “I’ve always
loved and admired Toppie and thought her a lovely
creature; but I confess to you, Alix—because you
understand her so well—that she has always seemed
to me a little heartless. Or is that too strong a word?
I don’t know. Something is lacking. She would spend
herself for people and do everything for them; there is
no selfishness in her at all; but it’s as if she’d do the
more because she felt the less, and had to make up for
it. It’s strange, Alix, selfish, warm-hearted people may
give much less pain than lovely people like Toppie.
Owen was selfish compared to Toppie; but I don’t
think he ever gave pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was like a pool, was he not?” said Alix, struggling
with thoughts Mrs. Bradley could not guess at;
“a pool rippling and perhaps shallow, but open to the
sun; and Toppie is like a well, cold and deep and narrow.
And Giles is like the sea; deep and broad, too.
How happy she might still be if she could love Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Yes.” The tears rose to Mrs. Bradley’s eyes.
“And all that he thinks of is to live for her and all that
she thinks of is that Owen is near her. Isn’t it cruel?—I
can’t believe that about darling Owen, you know. I
haven’t her faith, and that distresses her in me, too.
She doesn’t want to be with people who haven’t her
faith. I feel that. She doesn’t want anything that
seems to come in any way between her and him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if she did not believe him so near, so specially
near, she could think of Giles as near,” said Alix, while
a sense of unformulated fear, often felt, never seen,
seemed to press more closely upon her than ever before.
“It is Captain Owen who stands between them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid he will stand between them always,
Alix,” said Mrs. Bradley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles went off to the Rectory next morning. Ruth,
Rosemary, and the boys had planned a picnic with the
Eustaces, but Alix said that she would remain behind
with Mrs. Bradley. By luncheon-time Giles had not
returned and, exchanging glances over the table, each
knew that the other found hope in the prolonged absence,
for would Toppie keep Giles with her like this
unless all was going well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see him when he comes back, Alix,” said
Mrs. Bradley when, after luncheon, she stepped into
the car to drive off to the station. She had an address
to give in London that afternoon and would not be
back till late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, perhaps he will not want to see me,” said Alix.
“I shall be very discreet. I shall be there for him if he
wants me; but not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Giles would always want to see you, whatever
had happened to him,” said Mrs. Bradley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, Alix went out to her favourite walk, the
little path under the garden wall, half obliterated by
heather and grass, its bordering gorse bushes all broken
into soft clusters of gold set in prickles and smelling of
apricots. Bareheaded, her arms wrapped in her blue-and-grey
scarf, she walked, smelling the gorse, feeling
the sunshine, listening to a blackbird that fluted golden
arabesques on the April air; while above her head the
leaning fruit-boughs were full of thick grey-green buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sense of excitement that had been with her
since the day of Jerry’s declaration was immeasurably
deepened this afternoon by her imaginative sharing of
Giles’s ordeal. Jerry and Giles were mingled in her
thoughts, and her mind recoiled from the striving of
pain and hope and fear brought to it by their united
images. Perhaps it was because she thus evaded her
deep preoccupation, perhaps it was because she paced
thus in the sunlight, as he had paced, that her memory,
suddenly liberated, took a long flight backward to find
Grand-père going along the terrace at Montarel with
his dragging step and sombre eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so strange to think of Grand-père now. Since
the day of her first arrival in England he had hardly
visited her thoughts. And with what a new sadness
she saw him again and felt once more his melancholy
flow into her. Was it because she had for so long forgotten
him and gone so far from him and Montarel
that she felt thus suddenly the gloomy pressure of his
eyes? It was as if he watched her, her life involved in
lives so remote from his sympathy. It was not only
the young yearning of her heart towards Jerry’s yearning
that seemed a betrayal of Grand-père; this sharper
yearning, not towards but over Giles, showed her as
even more removed and alien. Young love Grand-père
might have understood; but hardly this identification
with an Englishman’s hopes and fears. She doubted
whether Grand-père had ever in his life spoken to an
English person. He had disliked the English. She recalled
how, when she read her history to him, he would
interrupt her to speak bitterly about them. “<span class='it'>Un
peuple pratique; sans idéal</span>,” he had said. And he had
said that England had always schemed against France
and made use of her grace and generosity. How
strange that was to remember now as she waited for
Giles and listened to the blackbird. They had not
schemed against her; France’s daughter; nor made use
of her. Would it not be truer to say that France,
through her helpless person, had schemed against and
made use of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maman schemed. Maman, with all her grace, her
generosity, was oh! so practical. “And our people eat
the blackbirds,” thought Alix while the song, as she
listened to it, brought Giles’s face vividly before her.
Jerry was like a goldfinch—golden flashes, summery
sweetness, swift eagerness, and gay inconsequent song.
Giles was the blackbird; its tenderness, its trust, its
something of heaven and something of drollery too;
and the way it brought long-past things back;—again;
again; again;—brooding on the past with persistent
fidelity. Faithful Giles; he would never forget.
And why did the thought of goldfinches merge into
this surreptitious aching? How strange it was that one
should feel the anxious pressure of a new thought
before one saw the thought itself! Goldfinches; Les
Chardonnerets; André de Valenbois; she traced the
sequence. Jerry made her think of André; only he was
not so finely tempered; not so intelligent. But the
thought of André was only a pain and a perplexity;
whereas Giles believed her to be in love with Jerry; she
had seen in his eyes that he believed her to be in love;
and perhaps she was; only it was round the problem of
worth that this new ache was centring. There must be
so much worth on the one hand if, on the other, it was
France that might have to be sacrificed. And Jerry
was like the goldfinches. “Worth,” she thought, listening
to the blackbird’s song. The word was such an
English word. She loved the blackbird’s song, best of
all, she said to herself, trying to turn away from the
still half-unseen trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, behind her, she heard Giles’s voice speaking
her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come up from the birch-woods; he had not
come from the Rectory. He had been walking; his
hair was ruffled with the wind; his shoes were muddy;
he had not eaten; he was very tired. Alix saw all this
in flashes as they approached each other, her mind
catching at such straws. For it was shipwreck that his
face revealed to her; so pallid, so haggard, with dark
pinches in the eyelids under the eyes and strange, ageing
furrows of suffering running down from his nostrils
to the corners of his mouth. Could the shipwreck of
all his hopes make Giles look like this? There had been
no hope to lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had spoken her name in a quite gentle voice, as if,
indeed, he were glad to find her there; as if she were a
haven for what he could drag of hull and spars up out
of reach of the battering waves. He walked beside her,
and said: “Can we get to the study without being
seen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are all out,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was curious to feel, as she said it, as, silently, they
made their way into the house, that it was as if they
had left him to her. Even his mother had left Giles
to her, and as they entered the study and she heard,
through the open window, the blackbird, far away,
still singing, she had the feeling of being in a dream.
The past fell back into a strange, flat tapestry, russet,
silver, blue, where the figures of Grand-père, Maman,
and Jerry all went together. She and Giles stood
against that background in the study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had walked in before her, to the window, and he
stood looking out as if he, too, were listening to the
blackbird, and when he turned at last and looked
at her it was as if he asked her what he should do
with himself. She saw him as a little boy who
needed a mother to take him to her breast. And, like
the little boy, he wanted his mother to ask him what
was the matter before he could speak. So Alix
asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice trembled as she spoke. That was why,
perhaps, Giles collapsed. He sank into the chair before
the table and laid his head upon his arms and burst out
crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix felt her heart stand still. “Captain Owen—Captain
Owen has parted them,” she thought. And
the unseen fear that had that morning pressed so near
was there beside her now. It was a compulsion laid
upon her; a necessity that was not now to be escaped,
though still she did not see it clearly. She stood by
Giles, gazing down at him, and her young face was
stern rather than pitiful. It was hardly of Giles that
she was thinking; or it was of his suffering rather than
of him. It was because of Giles’s suffering that the
necessity was laid upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when, as if he felt her near in his darkness, he
put out an arm and drew her to him, for the comfort
of her closeness, even while she thought, “I am his
mother now,” her face kept its sternness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke at last. “She’s going to leave us, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to leave us?” Alix wondered if Toppie were
dying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s going into a convent. She’s going to be a
nun. It was all settled at Bath. But she’s been meaning
it for a long time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I knew,” Alix murmured. “She told me that
on the first day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew?” In his astonishment Giles relinquished
his clasp and fixed his broken gaze upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On that first day. When I went to see her. She
told me that she could understand the wish to be a nun.
She told me that you had them in your Church. If
one were alone, she said, it might be the best life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles now got up and moved, stumbling, towards the
sofa, and, Alix following him, they sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because of him,” said Giles. He leaned his arm
on the end of the sofa and kept his face covered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of him,” Alix echoed, sitting straightly beside
him and bending all her strength to thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be more near him. She says she feels she can be
more near like that,” Giles spoke dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is not a vocation,” said Alix after a moment.
She was seeing the face of the old great-aunt at
Lyons behind the <span class='it'>grille</span>. Pale old eyes; pale cold lips;
a dead creature; yet—already the little child who
stood there before her for her blessing felt it—living
by a mysterious life unimaginable to those out in the
great turmoil of the world. “You go into a convent to
renounce the world,” she said. “Not to keep it more
near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Giles, and he uttered a hard laugh, “she
doesn’t count Owen as the world. She counts him as
heaven. He wasn’t worth it, you know, Alix,” said
Giles, with the hardness in his voice. “Owen wasn’t
worth a devotion like Toppie’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, while the word “worth,” laden with its thick
cluster of associations, seemed to set a heavy bell ringing
in her breast, Alix answered: “No; he was not
worth it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat then for a long time silent. Once or twice
Alix thought that Giles was going to speak to her. She
saw it all now; clearly at last; and must he, too, not
see? Must he not, in another moment, tell her of the
sudden resolve to which, at last, he found himself knit?
But when she turned her eyes—appalled, yet ready,
upon him, he was not looking at her; not thinking at
all of what she thought; gazing merely at the fireless
grate, his mind fixed on the one figure that filled it.
Toppie a nun; Toppie blotted out from any life where
he could see or hear her. And suddenly he said: “She
was so kind to me. She was so awfully sorry for me.
She’s never been so kind—It was almost—I could
see what it might have been—Oh, Alix, I’m so miserable!”
groaned Giles, and again he put his head down
on his arms and broke into sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix looked over at him. No; it was her task; not his.
Impossible for him; inevitable for her. It was a debt
to be paid. A debt of honour. More than that. It was
the crying out in her heart of intolerable grief. She
could not bear that Giles should suffer so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hardly noticed it when she laid her hand on his
head and said: “I will come back in a little while.” He
was broken. The waves were going over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left him there. She left the house. At the garden-gate,
looking through the sunlight across the common,
she stood still for a moment, feeling that she
paused, for the last time, in childhood, and that with
the next step she left it for ever behind her. It was she,
now, who took up life; who made it. Destiny went
with her; she was no longer its instrument, but its
creator. And in this last moment how strange it was to
hear the blackbird still singing:—It would always remember;
that was what it seemed to be saying:—It
would always remember. Even when she had forgotten
her childhood, the blackbird’s song would remember,
for her, how a child’s heart felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once outside upon the common she began to run.
She was carrying Giles’s heart in her hand and it was
heavy to carry. From the tapestry she felt Grand-père’s
stern eyes following her; and Maman’s eyes.
Intently, intently Maman’s eyes watched her as she
ran. She could not read their look. And far away, as if
he had forgotten her, Jerry rode into the blue distance
with ladies in hennins mounted on unicorns; figures
faded to the pattern of the background. Or was it she
who had forgotten Jerry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached the Rectory, she did not ring.
She entered softly, standing for a moment to regain
her breath and listen. Footsteps were moving in the
drawing-room. The drawing-room door was ajar. She
pushed it open and entered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie stood in the middle of the room with open
packing-cases around her. The sun came in and shone
upon the walls and the room looked pale and high and
vacant. There were no flowers anywhere; all the little
intimate things were gone. Toppie stood alone among
her doves. And upstairs, in Toppie’s room, the doves
brooded upon a little box where Captain Owen’s letters
lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was packing the books, carrying them from the
shelves that filled the spaces between the windows and
laying them in the boxes; and as Alix entered so softly,
closing the door behind her, she stood still, holding a
book in her hand and looking up with what, for a moment,
was only surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A horrible blow of pity assailed Alix as she saw her.
All in black; so white; so wasted, she was like the <span class='it'>cierge</span>
unlighted. “But it is for her sake, too,” Alix thought,
seeing Toppie sinking, sinking away from the world of
sun and friendship into the silence and solitude of the
grave. “Better to suffer; better to suffer dreadfully,
and come back to us,” she thought. And the visions
that had always accompanied her thoughts still moved
before her so that it was pain like fire she saw lifted in
her own hands towards the cold <span class='it'>cierge</span>; to light it into
life once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie stood holding her book and looking across
at her, and, all unbidden and unwelcome as she must
feel her guest to be, the deep fondness of her heart betrayed
itself by a faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to speak with you, Toppie,” said Alix.
She could not smile back. She could not go towards
Toppie with outstretched arms. The sofa where she
and Toppie always sat together was on the other side
of the room. She felt that she could not stand and tell
Toppie; her strength might forsake her; she might find
herself, when the moment came, turning away and
escaping. If she and Toppie were on the sofa it
would be safer. “I have seen Giles,” she said. “It is
because of what Giles has told me that I have come—May
I sit down? Will you come beside me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie said not a word. She stood there, her smile
vanished, holding the book, and watched her as she
crossed the room to the sofa and sank down upon it.
Then, after a moment, she laid down the book and followed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is very wrong of you, Alix.” These were the
words she found. Her mind, Alix saw, fixed itself upon
the time of her own former intercession for Giles.
Coldness gathered in her eyes. “Giles did not send
you, I am sure. You have no right to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, she had taken her place and was sitting there
in her black, waiting for what Alix had to say to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it must seem strange,” said Alix. “When
you have had so much to bear. But I had to come.
No, Giles did not send me. He would not have let me
come if he had known. He does not think of himself.
He thinks of you—only—always. Giles would never
lift a finger to save himself—although his heart might
be breaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix—this is impossible.” Toppie was scanning
her face with stern yet startled eyes. “No one knows
as well as I do what Giles would do for me.—You are
not yourself.—You seem to me to be hysterical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you do not know what he would do,” said Alix.
She felt that her heart had begun to knock with heavy
thuds against her side and a shudder passed through
her as she sat there straightly, her hands pressed together
in her lap, her gaze fixed on Toppie; but she saw
her way to the end of what she had to say and she
could say it. “You cannot know it. No one knows but
he and I—and my mother. He has spared you; and
he has spared someone else. But I must tell. Toppie,
your lover was not true to you. He did not love you as
you love him. He did not understand love as Giles
understands it, or love you with a tenth of the love
that Giles has given.—Oh, Toppie—I am sorry”—Toppie
had started to her feet and was drawing
away with a look of horror—“But you must know.
You must not shut yourself away from life because
of someone who is not with you at all.—It was my
mother that Captain Owen loved. He was with us
three times in Paris and he kept it from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mad! You do not know what you are saying.
Go away. Go away at once.” Toppie stood there
as if she had been a snake—ghastly with disgust and
repudiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not mad. It is true. Giles knows. I lied to
Mrs. Bradley when she asked me why we had never
seen Captain Owen again. When I saw that he had
hidden it, I lied. I did not understand why he had
kept it from you all and it was Giles who told me—that
it was because he had betrayed you by loving
Maman most. Three times he was with us in Paris
that Spring before he died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what you are saying?” Toppie stared
at her with dilated eyes. “Do you understand what
you are saying? Owen with you? Before he died?—Why
not? Why not?—He was your mother’s friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was friendship in Cannes. In Paris it was different.
Giles made me see why it was different. He
would not have kept it from you if it had been friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles? Giles made you see?” Toppie put her hands
to her head as if her skull cracked with the dreadful
blows Alix dealt her, and, while a deathly sickness
crept over her, Alix went on relentlessly: “He had
seen them together in Paris. They did not see him, but
he saw them walking in the Bois. That was why, when
I lied to his mother, he knew it was a lie. Last Winter,
Toppie; when I first came. And I was to help him in
keeping it from you always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie stood still, up there in the thin bright sunlight,
her hands pressed now before her face; and, with
the growing sickness, Alix suddenly seemed to see
another figure beside her. It was as if Maman, too,
was standing there, in the bright sunlight, with that
intent look; dumb, like a figure in a nightmare; yet in
her stillness conveying a terrible reproach. “It was
not Maman’s fault,” Alix muttered. “She cannot help
it if she is loved. She did not know that he had kept it
from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From behind Toppie’s hands now came a strange
voice. It was as if it spoke from the pressure of some
iron vice screwed down upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother is a wicked woman. You do not know
what you are saying; but I know that it is true. Your
mother took my lover from me. She is a wicked woman
and you are a miserable child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix felt herself trembling now in every limb; but it
was even more before Maman that she trembled than
before Toppie. “Is it wicked to be loved? Is it wicked
to be preferred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is wicked,” said Toppie in the crushed and
straining voice. “There is no greater sin for a woman
than such stolen love. Your mother is an abandoned
woman. She has lovers. No one is safe from her. I
knew that already!—Oh, God, I knew it!” Was
Toppie speaking on to her, or, in her agony, to herself?
Alix, standing outside the torture-chamber, heard the
cries of the victim. But she, too, was bound upon a
wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not wicked. You had a lover. Captain
Owen was your lover.” She forced her trembling lips
to speak. “Giles knows her. He knows that she is not
wicked. It is false what you say. You must not say
such false things of my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not understand,” Toppie moaned. She had
fallen down upon a chair, her face still hidden in her
hands. “It is terrible to be so ignorant as you are. You
are too old to be so ignorant.—Yes, it is true—all
true. She took him from me. Oh, I know now—I
know what Giles was hiding from me!—Go away,
Alix.—You drive me mad!—Go away, poor unhappy
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix had risen to her feet, but still she could not go.
To fly, to escape; to hide herself for ever; this was the
cry of all her nature; but there was something else.
It was not only upon herself, upon Maman, that she
had brought this disaster. What had she done to
Giles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not stay.—Do not think that I will stay.—You
say things of my mother that are not to be forgiven.—It
is only for Giles.—You will not blame
him? He has done nothing wrong. You will see him?
He will explain all that I have not understood.—It
is for Giles.—Oh, Toppie—all is not so lost when
Giles, who loves you, is still there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is lost. All, all lost,” Toppie murmured.
Her voice had sunken to ashes now. Her head hung
forward upon her hands. Looking at her, for the last
time, Alix seemed, dizzily, to see her as a figure in
a long-past epoch, a black figure, with bent fair head,
sitting in the pale room with the doves about it. It was
as if Toppie would sit on there for ever. “Oh, Owen!”
Alix heard her moan, as she went, unsteadily, to the
door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Maman!—What have I done to you!” It was
her own voice now that Alix heard. She was out again
upon the common and she had been running. But suddenly
she was walking very slowly among the gorse
bushes in the bright sunlight, and she could hardly drag
herself along. Her head ached as if it would break in
two; her limbs were of lead; and now that she went so
slowly she could no longer escape Maman. She saw
her there, moving beside her, with the intent look;
silent; without a word of blame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I done to you!” Alix muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maman went beside her, in her white dress, with the
heelless shoes such as she wore at Vaudettes, and bare-headed.
It was not blame. Maman’s look had passed
beyond all thought of blame; it had passed even beyond
pity. Alix saw suddenly that what it meant was
that she was waiting to see what Alix would now say to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must think. I must think,” Alix muttered to herself.
But she did not need to think. It was as if in a
kaleidoscope, turned in her hands, memories, till now
unrelated, fell suddenly into a pattern. “<span class='it'>La belle
madame Vervier. Divorcée, vous savez.</span>”—Grand-père’s
eyes. Giles’s silence, when they had met. That strange,
deep blush that had dyed Giles’s face when, in the
study, they had spoken of Captain Owen’s leaves in
Paris; André de Valenbois. Maman’s lie to André
about Toppie. All the things she had read in poetry,
in novels, of beautiful guilty women who had lovers.
And, creeping through her young heart like a slow
surreptitious flame—falling into place, curving with
darts of ardent colour into the pattern—most recent,
most intimate intuitions of what a woman’s love might
mean. “Maman!” she moaned. She fell at Maman’s
feet in supplication. Yet, while she implored her forgiveness,
she was sheltering her, too. She was putting
her arms around her to protect her from the world’s
cruel scrutiny. She was promising her—oh, with
what a passion of fidelity—that their love, the love
of mother and child, was unharmed, set apart, firmly
fixed and sacred for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached Heathside she heard that the little
boys had returned. They were shouting in the garden
with the dogs, and Alix retraced her steps, skirting the
kitchen-garden wall, going softly in by the little gate,
creeping along the back passages past kitchen and
scullery unobserved. Here was Giles’s study. She
turned the handle and went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was there, sitting at his desk and writing. He
had a sick, dogged look; but he had recovered his composure.
He even, as he turned his head and looked at
her, tried to summon a smile of welcome and she knew
that he felt ashamed for having broken down before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix shut the door and stood against it. “Giles, I
have done a dreadful thing,” she said. Only when she
leaned against the door did she know that she was almost
fainting. She felt that all that she desired was
sleep. To tell Giles and then to fall into oblivion. Far
away, in France, she saw where she and Maman, in a
sunny garden, walked hand in hand. They both seemed
very old. They were very sad. Yet they smiled at each
other. But this vision was far away. The black ordeal
was before her. “I have done a dreadful thing,” she
repeated. “Perhaps you will not forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had risen to his feet and stood, over against
the window, tall and dark with his ruffled head. He
was looking at her and his eyes were frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been to Toppie,” said Alix. “I have told her
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not find a word to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for your sake I did it, Giles,” said Alix in a
dry, unappealing voice. “I told her so that she might
know it was you who loved her; not he. Perhaps you
will not forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles spoke. “You told her about Owen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About Owen. That he was Maman’s lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles put his hand up and pushed it through his hair.
“You told her that for my sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Giles. So that she should not leave you to be
nearer him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know what you were saying, Alix?” said
Giles, after another moment; and after yet another
moment Alix answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when I told her. But afterwards. After what
she said. She said that Maman was a wicked woman.
She said that Maman was a woman who had lovers.
She said that for a woman there is no greater sin. And
now, I think, I understand. Giles—Is it true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling little Alix,” said Giles in a strange,
stern voice, “it is true. But she’s not wicked. She’s
wrong; but not wicked. She’s lovely, and unfortunate,
and wrong, and she needs your love more than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Giles spoke these words, Alix suddenly stumbled
forward. She put out her hands blindly—for as she
heard him her tears rushed down from under shut lids—and
Giles’s arms received her. She was sobbing
against his breast. “Oh, Giles, thank you! Oh, Giles,
do you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling child—my darling little Alix—I
understand it all,” said Giles.</p>

<div><h1>PART IV</h1></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Two faces were with Giles that night as he turned,
sleepless, again and again, on his pillow; Alix’s face,
and Toppie’s face. Toppie was before him as he had
seen her on the Autumn evening in the birch-woods
when she had looked away from him with the wildness
in her eyes and had said: “It’s as if there might be
anything. As if you might hide anything. She’s
changed you so much.” She was before him as she
said: “It’s as if she might have changed Owen—if
he had ever come to know her as well as you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was he himself, in his stumbling confusion, his
half truths and his half loyalties, who had that evening
set the deadly surmise before her. She had not, he believed,
since seeing it, drawn a breath at ease. She
would have been ready for what Alix had come to tell
her. She would have known, at the first word, that it
was true. He saw her freeze to stillness before the
Medusa head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, if Toppie’s face brought the groan of helpless
pity to his lips while he tossed and turned, an even
deeper piercing came in the thought of Alix. She stood
there, against the study door, facing him; facing the
deed she had done; facing a truth worse than Toppie’s.
Toppie saw herself betrayed by what she had most
loved. But Alix saw herself as a betrayer. Her look
was that of a creature at bay, with wolves at its throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, with a suffocating compassion, he saw her
blind, outstretched hands; he heard her gasping breath:
“Giles—Is it true?” His arms received her and he
felt her sobs against his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She became, while his comprehension yearned over
her, part of himself. Something fiercely tender, something
trembling and awe-struck dawned in his heart as
he held her. To understand Toppie was to see her sink
away from him. To understand Alix was to see her
enter his very flesh and blood. It was for him that she
had dared the almost inconceivable act; and, as he
thus saw her offered up in sacrifice for him, Giles knew,
with all that had been destroyed, something beautiful
had been given. It was his justification for the act that
he had, from the beginning, dared for her. It was the
answer to an old perplexity. He had seen the dear little
French girl as so securely secular, so serenely pagan;
so hard. His perplexity had centred round the word
Holiness and he had feared that she might be impervious
to its meaning. But as quietness descended
slowly upon his troubled heart Giles saw, while a
sense of radiance grew about him, that it was Alix
herself who showed him further meanings in the
word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found on waking next morning that, with all the
sense of calamity that lay like a physical weight on his
heart, the sense of beauty, of something gained, still
shone round him. He needed light, for his path was
dark with perplexity. Alix had left him yesterday to
go to her room, and to bed. In the few words that
passed between him and his mother on her return from
London the child’s shattered state was sufficiently
explained by Toppie’s decision. Toppie’s decision, he
felt, explained his state, too. Mrs. Bradley heard of it
with consternation. “A nun, Giles! A convent!” she
had gasped. Generations of candid Protestantism
spoke in the exclamation. Nuns and convents were,
to Mrs. Bradley, strange, alien, almost sinister anachronisms.
Dim pictures from Fox’s “Book of Martyrs”
and the “Pilgrim’s Progress” floated across her mind
as she heard Giles. And tears rose to her eyes as she
saw an end, not only to all his hopes, but to every link
that bound them to Toppie. There was no need to explain
anything further to his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had to face at breakfast the dismay of Ruth and
Rosemary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Alix! She’s bowled out completely.—Says
she doesn’t want any breakfast; but I’m going to take
her up a tray,” said Rosemary. “No, not kidneys,
Jack; if you’re ill in bed you don’t want kidneys;—a
boiled egg’s the thing, and toast, and tea. She looks
rotten; perfectly rotten. She’s awfully fond of Toppie,
you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there’s no good whatever in my going
over and seeing what I can say to Toppie,” Ruth ventured
to her brother when breakfast was over. “If
she’d only let herself be psycho-analysed by Miriam
Stott it would be sure to help. Miriam is extraordinary,
you know. She’s a friend of the Burnetts; she does it
professionally. Toppie is just a case for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Ruth,” said Giles, “I’m sure you mean
well; but you are sometimes an arrant ass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well,” said Ruth to her sister when
Giles had gone to shut himself in his study; “ass or no
ass, I’ve thought for some time now that Toppie was
quite liable to go off her chump. It’s sexual repression
coming out in religious mania; plain as day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sexual repression!” Rosemary stared. “What an
extraordinary thing to say, Ruth! Toppie’s no more
repressed than you or I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is. Sensible people like you and me work
it off, sublimate it, in games and work and all sorts of
healthy activities, whereas poor foolish Toppie has always
moped and brooded at home, never knowing
what she was or what she wanted. You’re old enough
to read Freud now, Rosemary, and the sooner you do
the better. He will explain it all to you.” Ruth’s universe
was of the latest tabloid variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, meanwhile, in his study, sat and wondered
what he should do next. Until he had seen Alix again
he did not know. How could he go to Toppie? What
was there to say to Toppie? He had answered all her
questions on the Autumn afternoon in the birch-woods.
He had answered all her questions about Owen, and he
had answered all her questions about himself. She had
seen him on that afternoon place himself on the side of
madame Vervier. “She is the product of her mother,”
he had said of Alix. “Do you find fault with it?” He
had showed himself as understanding madame Vervier;
as exculpating her. Toppie might come to forgive
Owen, caught in the horrible siren’s net; she would
never, he believed, forgive him. Unless she sent for
him, how could he go to her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of these reflections he heard a motor
drive up to the door and, going to look out, saw with
astonishment Lady Mary Hamble descending from it.
Lady Mary could only have come to see Alix and, after
she had disappeared, he stood wondering what Alix
would find to say to her. He had, while he had brooded
on their disaster, almost forgotten Alix’s love-story
and it seemed now to have lost all its potency. Jerry
was too light, too boyish to face the resolutions that
would now be needed. “She’s too good for him,” Giles
muttered to himself, as he had muttered of the French
order on the summer day at Les Vaudettes, standing
with bent head and hands in his pockets as if listening
for what next was to happen. Too good for him. Yet
perhaps Jerry would not fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was next to happen did not long delay, and the
sight of his mother’s face in the doorway warned him
that it was something quite unforeseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Giles, dear!—Will you come?” Rarely had
he heard his mother’s voice so shaken, and if her face
had shown consternation last night it was almost horror
that it showed this morning. “Lady Mary is here,”
she said. “She came to see me. Oh, Giles—it is about
poor little Alix. Lady Mary has heard—terrible
things about her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it had fallen. Better so, perhaps, thought Giles,
as for a moment he stared at his mother in a receptive
silence before following her to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary was there, floating, to Giles’s sense, in an
indefiniteness, made up of lovely hesitancy, veils, and
a touch of tears, that was yet more definite than a
steely armour. She came towards him at once with
outstretched hands, saying: “Dear Giles, perhaps you
can help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For it can’t be true, can it, Giles?” Mrs. Bradley
urged in her shaken voice. She was so much more worn
than Lady Mary, yet she looked so much younger and
Giles read on her face a resentment, all unconscious,
against Lady Mary and her standards. “You know
her, Giles, and can explain. She’s unconventional,
isn’t she, and unworldly, and might do unusual things
and be misjudged by worldly people;—but Alix’s
mother can’t be a bad woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he found himself face to face once more with the
bad woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to come and see if you could tell me more.
I’m so fond of darling little Alix.” Lady Mary had
beautifully placed herself in a corner of the sofa, her
furs unfolded, her long veil cast back from the framing
velvet of her little hat. She was not thinking about
looking beautiful;—Giles did her justice;—but she
was thinking, very intently, about doing what she had
to do as beautifully as possible, and that intention
seemed to dispose her hands across the sables of her
muff, to cross her silken ankles and tilt to a most
appealing angle the pearls that glimmered in her
ears. “You see—Jerry— It’s all foolishness”—she
found her way. “He’s only a boy.—He falls in
love with someone different every six months.—He
fancies himself in love with Alix now—and I don’t
wonder at it. She’s the most enchanting young girl
I’ve seen for years.—But Marigold Hamble, my
husband’s niece, heard in Paris, just the other day,
such deplorable things. Deplorable.” Lady Mary’s
voice sank to the longest, saddest emphasis. “Marigold
is a wretched gossip, and worse.—She’s a <span class='it'>mauvaise
langue</span>; I would not trust her story. But she
gave chapter and verse to such an extent that I had to
come to you—since you know madame Vervier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But gossip is always like that,” Mrs. Bradley persisted,
a spot of colour on each cheek. “Some people
see evil in everything. And Giles liked her. And everything
Alix has told me of her is so lovely. And my
son, Owen, who is dead, was devotedly attached to
her. It is because he was so fond of her mother that
Alix is with us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, after that, Lady Mary’s soft, bright
eyes, from between the veils and the pearls, remained
fixed on Mrs. Bradley’s candid countenance and Giles
knew that his mother had revealed more of the miserable
truth to Lady Mary than she herself, he hoped,
would ever know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite right, Mummy, darling. I do like
her,” so he felt impelled to sustain her, though he knew
that such sustainment might only be for her immediate
bewilderment. “I do like her,” he repeated, turning
his eyes on Lady Mary and bidding her make what
use she liked of the information. And then he found
the words he had used to Alix yesterday: “She’s not
bad. She’s unfortunate and wrong. But, it’s true:—I
found out while I was with her, that she is a woman
who—” poor Giles paused, while Lady Mary and
his mother gazed at him—“who,” he finished, “has
lovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this, it was Mrs. Bradley who first spoke.
“Has lovers, Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could almost have smiled—but he was nearer
weeping at his mother’s voice. Steeped to the lips in
the woes of the world as she was, lovers—for anyone
one knew—for anyone in one’s own walk of life—was
an idea almost as alien, and even more strange
and sinister, than nuns and convents. Poor little shop-girls
and housemaids had lovers, though usually known
less romantically as the fathers of illegitimate babies;
she had spent much time and strength in dealing with
such sad cases and in pleading on committees that the
man was most at fault. But even with Ruth flourishing
Freudian theories before her and the latest novels
of the newest young writers lying on her tables, Mrs.
Bradley thought of unhallowed relations between men
and women as of dark, mysterious deviations from the
obvious standards of civilization. And now she heard
Giles say that Alix’s mother had lovers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has had them for years and years, dear Mrs.
Bradley,” Lady Mary sadly but firmly defined for her.
“Ever since she left Alix’s father with, let us trust, the
first of them. With the monsieur Vervier, who, Marigold
heard, has never divorced her, and still lives. The
last is an André de Valenbois and Marigold met his
people. It was from them she heard the story, and
from what Giles says I see it is all too true. She is
a very distinguished, very dignified <span class='it'>demi-mondaine</span>.
Quite, quite notorious. She’s as well known in Paris,”
said Lady Mary with a sigh, relinquishing madame
Vervier’s corpse, as it were, to float down the tide of
her destiny, “as the Mona Lisa. The masses may not
know about her, but everybody else does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite so bad as that, is it?” said Giles. He
knew, while he listened to Lady Mary, that it would be
difficult to say why it was not so bad; but the loyalty
to madame Vervier that had so direfully betrayed him
to Toppie rose up in grief and anger against these
suave definitions. “Madame Vervier isn’t mercenary,”
he said. “To be a <span class='it'>demi-mondaine</span> you must be mercenary.
And I’m sure,” he added, while his mother’s
eyes, aghast, and Lady Mary’s eyes, imperturbably
kind, dwelt on him, and he knew that to the one he
appeared ominously mature, and to the other attractively
boyish;—“I’m sure that Alix is legitimate; if
that’s any comfort to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why are you sure?” Lady Mary asked, Mrs.
Bradley remaining helplessly silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She confided in me,” said Giles, and it was more
difficult to face Lady Mary’s kindness than his
mother’s dismay. “She was absolutely straight with
me. It was when we talked about Alix that she told me
everything. It was then I came to like her so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Giles”—poor Mrs. Bradley now almost
wept—“how can you say you like these dreadful
people? You made friends with monsieur de Valenbois,
too—how can you like them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear Mrs. Bradley,” said Lady Mary with
just the brush of a smile across her lips, “one <span class='it'>does</span> like
them. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dissolute people? People with no sense of conduct
or duty? I’ve never met them. Giles has never, I am
sure, met them before. I don’t understand,” said Mrs.
Bradley, and her drawing-room seemed to be saying
that it did not understand either;—the Watts’s
“Love and Life” and “Love and Death,” the bowls of
primroses picked by Jack and Francis, the crétonne
covers, and the crayon drawing of Mrs. Bradley’s
grandmother, a dove-eyed lady with lace tied over her
head and a cameo brooch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve met them,” said Lady Mary with sad equanimity.
“I’ve cared very much for several women who
were, alas, in that sense, dissolute. Only they were
more fortunate than madame Vervier; or more discreet.
They’ve not been dissolute openly. So one
hasn’t had to lose them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And one’s sons can marry their daughters,” said
Giles. His mind was occupied by no anger against
Lady Mary; only by that grief on madame Vervier’s
account; and on Alix’s. Lady Mary he felt that he
liked; much as he liked—it was the strangest feeling—madame
Vervier. Lady Mary, too, was straight;
she, too, was magnanimous; and, her eyes on his, she
was liking him, liking him even while, not yielding an
inch, she answered: “Exactly. One’s sons can marry
their daughters. The difference couldn’t be put more
clearly.” And she went on, reminding him more and
more of madame Vervier, “Some things fit in and
some things don’t. Women who have kept their place,
fit; women who have lost it, don’t. It’s very harsh; it’s
very hypocritical, you will say, Giles; but it is the only
way in which a civilized society can protect itself. It’s
impossible to judge each case on its own merits; so
rules are made and the people who transgress them pay
the penalty. It isn’t really that they are put out; they
put themselves out. One pretends about them as long
as they allow one to go on pretending. And when it
comes to the sons and daughters;—young people
don’t realize how horrid, how crippling, simple awkwardness
can be. How awkward, for instance, to have
a mother-in-law you couldn’t possibly, ever, invite to
the house; how awkward to have babies to whom
you’ve given a <span class='it'>demi-mondaine</span> for a grandmother. It
becomes too difficult. One wants to spare one’s children
such difficulty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what does one want to spare Alix?” Giles
asked. With all his liking, with all her grace, her frankness,
her resolve not to hurt, he was feeling for Lady
Mary the same repudiation that he had felt for the
ladies of the chalet—the people who connived and
had no right to reject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary thought for a moment before saying:
“Alix can marry someone who doesn’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But anyone good enough to marry Alix would have
to mind,” said Giles. “Wouldn’t you be the first to say
that where she belongs is with the people who do mind?
What you really mean”—and Giles heard that his
voice became rather bitter as he went on—“is that
the daughter of the <span class='it'>demi-mondaine</span> must stay in the
<span class='it'>demi-monde</span>. I wouldn’t blame you if you weren’t so
fond of Alix for herself. I wouldn’t blame you if it
were a moral objection; but it isn’t. Those friends of
yours are only in because they’ve escaped being divorced.
Your objection to Alix is really, when you
come to look at it, that her mother is unfortunate.—Isn’t
that so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Lady Mary reminded him, vividly now, of
madame Vervier. Her soft gaze was fixed upon him
with something of the same surprise, yet with all of
the same security, that madame Vervier’s had shown.
Madame Vervier, in Lady Mary’s place, would feel
precisely as she did. And he could see madame Vervier,
after the little pause, bow her head as Lady Mary
bowed hers in saying: “I accept it all. That is my
objection. Her mother is too unfortunate. That is exactly
what it comes to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradley, shut out from her son’s understanding
and from Lady Mary’s tolerance, looked from one
to the other of them, a deepening flush on her girlish
cheeks. “But it’s worse, far worse than unfortunate,”
she said. “How could she have lived a life like that
with a little daughter to care for? It isn’t as if she had
had only to leave a bad husband, Giles. One could
have understood that; one could have felt her right.
But to have lovers—Don’t say only unfortunate
when it’s so much worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did say she was wrong, you know, Mummy.”
Poor Giles rubbed his hand through his hair. “She
knows how wrong I think her. I told her. But the
point for us is to make up to Alix for her mother’s
wrongness, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must keep her here,” said Mrs. Bradley. “We
must keep her away from her mother’s life. It is too
terrible to think of our darling little Alix exposed to
such depravity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what I felt, you see,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary was observing him. “You have been
making up to Alix from the first, haven’t you, Giles?”
she said, and though the kindness of her voice was unaltered
there was in it a touch of dryness, too. “You’ve
been engaged from the first in rescuing her from the
<span class='it'>demi-monde</span>. It must have been a wonderful scene that
between you and madame Vervier, when you told her
how wrong you thought her and promised her to do
your best to place Alix in another world than hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, his hand still clutched in his hair, now stared
at Lady Mary, arrested. “It was you who sought Alix
out, you know,” he reminded her after a moment. “It
wasn’t I who asked for anything for her. You took
your chances with Alix, just as we did. It was all on
your own responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Giles—I don’t blame you in the least for not
telling me,” Lady Mary assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Giles would have none of such assurances. “I
didn’t imagine you could. I hadn’t told my own
mother. If anyone can blame me, it’s she.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m sure she forgives you,” said Lady Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, of course, darling,” Mrs. Bradley, confused,
murmured. “How could you have done differently?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you think, then,” Lady Mary, all mildness,
continued, “that it would never come out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew it would have to come out if Alix ever got
married,” said Giles. “In your case, I knew that you
and madame Vervier were to meet. Alix had seen to
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Lady Mary meditated, her eyes on his.
“Alix saw to it. Yes; you knew you could count on
Alix. We can all count on Alix. Alix was perfect.”
She had moved away from the theme of reproach, but
it still smarted in Giles and it was with a heavy gaze
that he listened as she went on, sweetly showing him
that she, too, appreciated to the full their little French
girl. “She made everything clear. I never met such
clearness. It was wonderful to hear her on that day.
Jerry had really, I believe, touched her heart a little—poor
little dear—but the last thing she was thinking
about was her own heart. She was thinking of all
sorts of strange claims and duties. The children, if she
married, would have to be Catholics, she told me! And
she could not marry anyone who asked her to give up
France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you recognize,” said Giles, his heavy gaze
on her, “that she would have been just as perfect if,
not being French and not being a Catholic, she’d accepted
Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then as if, in the heavy eyes of the young man
sitting there, Lady Mary found herself arrested by an
unfamiliar image of herself. She had come to do exquisitely
what had to be done; and to do it so exquisitely
that the element of forbearance in her attitude
should be barely, if at all, perceptible. She was, perhaps,
doing it exquisitely; but the mirror of dispassionate
contemplation presented to her in Giles’s gaze
showed her, for perhaps the first time in her life, an
unbecoming distortion of her features. She might have
been seen as poised there, regretting that she had
exposed herself to the revelation. Then, feeling, no
doubt, that no evasion was possible, she submitted
to seeing that while she could retain the grace of
candour she must lose the grace of disinterestedness,
and answered: “She wouldn’t have been nearly so perfect
for my purposes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, at that, turned his eyes away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, the truth is, my dear Giles,” said Lady
Mary, and it was perhaps not the least part of her discomfort
to know that he was uncomfortable for her,
“dear little Alix needs someone better and braver to
deal with her situation than I can afford to be. Someone
quite, quite detached and devoted must fall in love
with her; someone without a worldly mother to shackle
his impulses.—I’m sure he will turn up,”—Lady
Mary’s smile dwelt on him, but Giles did not meet it.
“And as far as I am concerned, my best security is
Alix herself. I’m perfectly aware of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your difficulty, then?” Giles inquired,
still averting his eyes from Lady Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jerry, of course,” she said, glad to escape to
the wider theme. “He won’t leave it where Alix made
it so possible to leave it. He is indignant with me and
furious with Marigold. He says he won’t give up Alix
if her mother is a Messalina. I’m afraid he’s coming
here to see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you rather proud of him?” Giles inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear Giles, I am not proud of him!” Lady
Mary now gave herself the relief of impatience, and
Jerry was to bear the weight of her discomposure. “He
isn’t like Alix. He doesn’t see other people’s point of
view. He is thinking only of himself. It was just the
same last year when he wanted to marry a little
dancer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s thinking of Alix as well as of himself. And
you must own that he’s improved in taste since last
year,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Lady Mary now, and her eyes searched
his. “Does that mean that you’re going to help Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles reflected. “It means, I suppose, that I’m going
to help Alix. If he’s really good enough for Alix—of
course I’ll do my best for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Lady Mary gazed deeply at each other. She
was clever. She was as clever as madame Vervier. She
saw that she had not concealed herself from him and
that he had recognized her intimations; first that, again
the old dog Tray, he should marry Alix himself, and
then, that if he did not marry her, he should at all
events secure Jerry from the unpropitious match by
removing her. Yet, still, he liked Lady Mary. “Why
don’t you stand by them?” he suddenly suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that, Lady Mary rose; mournful, but showing no
reprobation. “I would stand by them, of course, if it
had to be. But I must try to prevent its being. I must
stand by my darling, that’s what it comes to, as you
must stand by yours. Jerry is my only child. I don’t
want madame Vervier in my family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could count on her, too, you know,” said Giles.
“She’d do everything to make it easy, for Alix’s sake.
You see, already she gives her up to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—but only because of what she hopes you can
do for her!” Lady Mary exclaimed, and it was now,
again, with the note of impatience. “No; the only
person I count upon is Alix herself. I don’t see Alix
entering a family that doesn’t want her. She will draw
back when she feels that we can’t come forward. She’ll
send Jerry away—whatever her mother, or you, or
Jerry himself, may say—when she sees that he speaks
for himself alone. And Jerry, when he’s given a little
time, will come to feel that it’s all too difficult. After
all, they’re only children. Little by little he will forget
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you?” asked Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mary, with sweetest, softest emphasis, had
pressed Mrs. Bradley’s hand in farewell and now moved
beside him to the door. She was gracefully occupied in
swathing and enfolding; she dropped her veil; she drew
her furs together; she avoided meeting again the mirror
of his eyes; and she said: “At my age one has learned
to give up things. I must give up my dear little Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made Giles think of a soft white hand, withdrawing
itself, while avoiding all danger of a rent,
from a glove that has proved a misfit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Giles got back to his study, he found Alix there,
looking out of the window. The sound of Lady Mary’s
motor had hardly died away. He saw that there was
nothing now that could be concealed from Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had come to speak about my mother,” said
Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange to hear her say, “my mother,” and
pitiful. Her voice was strange; yet he knew, in seeing
her, that he, too, whatever her sufferings might be,
must count upon Alix. It was Alix who would shield
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Marigold Hamble has just come back from
Paris,” he said. The gas-fire was alight this morning,
burning rather low. He went to it and turned it up so
that there should be a brighter glow; and then, since
there was nothing he could say to Alix, he waited for
what she would find to say. She watched him while he
bent to the fire. He felt her eyes on him. Then, with a
slow step, she came forward and sank down in her corner
of the sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix was very pale; her eyes were set in dark circles.
Glancing at her, Giles wondered with how much of
strength she thus, after the shipwreck of the day before,
possessed herself before him. He guessed from
her attitude as she sat there, straightly, yet leaning a
little against the cushion, that it had only been by the
determined exercise of her will that she had forced herself
to rise on hearing the motor arrive, and to descend
to meet whatever fresh disaster her presence among
them might have given birth to. She had parted from
him the day before, broken, speechless, disfigured with
weeping; but now she showed him only calm. Sorrow
had not softened or disintegrated her. It had knitted
her to a new hardness, and what she found to say as
she sat there looking into the fire was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Mrs. Bradley knows now, too. Everybody
knows about my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t conceal anything, Alix, dear,” said
Giles, dreadfully troubled. “Everybody who meets her
must come to know that her life is—unconventional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Mrs. Bradley know that I know?” Alix
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” said Giles. “I told her just now that I’d
rather not talk about it for a little while. She’s a good
deal knocked up. But, if you agree, all I need say to
her, Alix, dear, is that I myself have explained to you
the grounds of Lady Mary’s objection. Toppie, I am
sure, will say nothing. Mummy need never know more
than what she’s learned from Lady Mary. She doesn’t
know what Toppie knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix sat silent, looking into the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We needn’t talk about any of that, you see, any
more,” Giles took up presently, having walked to the
window and back again while he raged at his helplessness.
“Never forget what I said to you yesterday.
That’s all you need understand. I’ll make Mummy
understand it, too. And as for you, she only loves you
the more because of your—your difficulties. What
we must talk about, you know, is Jerry. I’d really forgotten
all about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I had, too.” Alix did not raise her eyes.
“What is there to say of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, his hands in his pockets, gazed down at her.
“He hasn’t forgotten you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he soon may learn to,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Alix, Jerry is sticking to you,” Giles protested.
“Jerry is all right. I’m very pleased about
him. I thought it probable he wasn’t good enough for
you and now I find he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite sure he is good enough. That is not the
question,” said Alix. She sat there, leaning slightly
against her cushion, her hands folded in her lap, and
looked into the fire. “I need not think of Jerry now.
I have only one person to think about, and that is my
mother. I must go back to her at once. To-morrow,
Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you’re not going to chuck Jerry!” cried
Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, at this, Alix raised her eyes to his,
and it was as if in their dim surprise he read a reproach;
the reproach of a serious race who saw facts as they
were. There was no humility or confusion in Alix. She
would not say to him that it was she who was not good
enough for Jerry; but certain facts were there and her
glance told him that he did not help her by pretending
not to see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Jerry,” was what she said and she then looked
back at the fire. “I am sorry if he is to be made sad.
But it will not be for long. He will get over it,” said
Alix, and her voice was almost the voice of madame
Vervier and of Lady Mary. “He is so young. And he
must come to see that with objections on both sides
what he hoped for is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles now came and sank down on the other end of
the sofa. He had not been pretending. He saw the
facts quite as clearly as Alix could ask him to do; but
what it really came to was that his race, he believed
with all his heart, saw further and more important
facts than the French did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he said, while Alix continued to gaze
at the fire, “I don’t believe you are looking at it in the
right way. You’re looking at it as—as his mother
does, as your mother would, from the point of view of
convention. Why impossible since you care for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it would not be happy,” said Alix, who
felt, evidently, no uncertainty. “It would have been
an unsuitable marriage before, when mine were the
only objections; it is much less suitable now. Such a
marriage would make his mother very unhappy. I do
not believe it could make my mother happy either. We
do not think of marriage, we French people, as you do.
What you think wrong, we think right; convention,
suitability is right for us. We are not romantic in your
English way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you really believe that your way is the
right way, Alix?” Giles inquired. “Can you imagine
anything more unhappy than having to spend your
life with someone you don’t love? That’s what the
<span class='it'>mariage de convenance</span> must often mean;—and, since
one hasn’t found love in marriage, looking for it afterwards
outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s eyes, as Giles thus indicated the tragic unveiled
figure that stood between them, remained fixed
upon the fire and she did not flush. She only seemed to
meditate, and, after a further pause, she said: “Even
marriages for love sometimes end like that. People’s
hearts may change. The heart is not always a guide.
That is perhaps the great difference; we do not believe
that the heart is the guide; and you do. We believe
that since the heart can make such mistakes—both
inside and outside of marriage—we must depend on
other things as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the suitable things, you mean,” said Giles.
“But isn’t it better to make mistakes for ourselves,
and to abide by the consequences, than to have other
people make them for us? As for suitability, in all the
essentials you and Jerry are perfectly matched. It’s
absurd to wreck his happiness and yours because his
mother finds disadvantages in your mother’s position.
Do look at it straight, Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do look at it straight, Giles,” said Alix. “And
all that I can see is that it would be impossible for me
to marry Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this a little silence fell between them. It was
strange to feel, sitting there in the familiar room, with
Alix beside him, that the grief that had brought them
so near had also set them apart. Alix had never been
so near him as yesterday; she had never been so far as
now. A cold apprehension entered Giles’s heart as he
felt it. If with her first step into maturity she was so
removed, how much might not the future remove her?
What claim, what charm could England have for Alix
now? And as if she answered his thoughts she said:
“Will you help me to go back to Maman to-morrow,
Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Alix,” cried Giles, rising and walking
up and down the room, “why go now? How would
you explain your sudden return to her? Surely you’re
not going to deal her such a blow as to let her know
what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have thought of it all, Giles,” said Alix, “and
Jerry will be my explanation. She knows of Jerry’s
offer of marriage, and what is more natural than that I
should return to her if his family object to me? I shall
tell Maman nothing; but I hope that she soon will feel
that she has nothing more to hide from me. When
Maman knows that his family object, she will be able,
very soon, to guess why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles had turned at the end of the room. “You need
never say anything, you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need never say anything”—Alix looked back
at him—“except that Marigold Hamble went to
Paris and that when she came back and had seen Lady
Mary they objected. Maman will guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well; and after that? What then? When she’s
guessed,” Giles asked, “what is gained?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is gained is that I shall have my right to be
with her. I shall have my right to help her. While she
had things to hide I could not help her; she would not
let me. Now, if other things should fail her,” said Alix,
“she will know that I am there to be depended upon.”
And with the words it was as if he saw her go forward
and take the tragic unveiled figure by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must have felt some strain in his wide gaze, for,
meeting it, she turned away her eyes, adding: “It was
Maman’s mistake ever to have sent me here. I felt
that long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine to have kept you, then.” Giles turned to
look out of the window, struggling with the sense of
tears. His little Alix! To what did she return? What
was the destiny there before her in the jungle? “Do I
count for nothing in all this?” he asked. “I wanted
you to stay in the first place for your own sake. I want
you to stay now for mine. Put Jerry aside. Think of
me for a moment. I’ve nobody but you. You’re the
only person in the world who knows what I’ve been
through, and isn’t it true that I’m the only person who
understands your life? That’s a bond, isn’t it? What
shall we do without each other?” said Giles, and, helplessly,
his voice was a younger voice at that moment
than Alix’s. He was the lonely little boy begging not to
be abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind him Alix was silent for a moment; then she
said, very gently: “But even if I had not Maman to
think of, Giles, we should not be together; you will be
in Oxford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my idea is that you should come to Oxford
next year and study at Somerville. Even while you
were here we’d see each other constantly. It would be
everything to know that you were near by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is impossible, dear Giles,” said Alix. It was
the same word she always found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to her from the window. “Do you mean
because of Toppie? My mother? Toppie will be leaving
us. My mother’s first thought was that we must
keep you always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wishes to keep me in order to keep me from
Maman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t know your mother. I’ll make her understand.
She wants to keep you because she’s so
fond of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s not enough now, Giles,” said Alix, looking
across at him. “You must see yourself that that
cannot now be enough. Anyone who loves me now
must take in Maman too. It is Maman I must think
of. And my place is beside her. You will see it, too,
dear Giles, when you have had time to think. I must
go to-morrow, and you must help me. Will you, Giles,
for I have no money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that he must yield. Such resolution could
not be opposed. And after all wasn’t it best to let
her go? He would have struggled against her longer
had it not come to him that nothing would move
further the cause he had at heart, Jerry’s cause, and
Alix’s, than her withdrawal. Better, much better, were
Lady Mary to see that Alix was removed; better for
Jerry that he should find something to endure and
wait for and win with difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, more than all the rest, he was sustained by that
sense of secure radiance that had come to him from
Alix herself. Wherever she was, whatever befell her,
Alix would be safe. He could not have given way, he
could not have consented to see her go, if he had not
felt sure of it. So it ended as she had meant it to end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’ll help you, dear,” he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Alix off next day. Her departure cast consternation
through the Bradley household. An unfortunate
love affair, the fact that Alix did not wish to
marry Jerry Hamble, could not be made to bear the
weight of such a sudden mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always knew those Hambles would do her no
good!” cried Rosemary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth is, if you ask me,” said Ruth, “that she
wants to go back to France. She’s never really cared
about being here at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But against this Jack and Francis protested hotly,
asserting that Alix liked nothing better than playing
games with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Mrs. Bradley was dismayed. Giles could do
nothing to make her understand. “But she’s been
happy here; I know she’s been happy,” she said. “I
see that you can’t explain to her why she should stay
with us. But, oh, Giles, she ought to stay till she is
much, much older. We can take her away. I can take
her to Edinburgh, to stay with the Raeburns, if she
wants to avoid Mr. Hamble—I’ll do anything to keep
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles could only reiterate: “Alix is very wise,
Mummy. You must trust her to know best. I think
she suspects already that things aren’t happy with her
mother; and she wants to be near her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother asked him not another question about
madame Vervier. She made no surmises about Owen’s
friendship. Giles at moments wondered, with all her
ingenuousness, whether some dim suspicion had not
entered her mind, as it had entered Toppie’s, and he
blessed her for her gift of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought for a moment that Alix was going to cry
when she bade his mother good-bye; tears were in Mrs.
Bradley’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darling, whenever you want to come back to us—you
will know;—we’ll always be waiting, Alix,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, old thing,” said Rosemary staunchly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll come to see you in France,” Ruth assured
her, “at your Vaudettes place; though I do hate
shingle to bathe on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of you must come, whenever you will,” Alix
murmured, pale in her little blue buttoned cape. Alix
knew what they did not know, that they would never
be allowed to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw the last of her. She stood leaning on
the railing of the steamer deck, Blaise in his basket beside
her, and waved to him until the blue mist of the
April day dissolved her form, and as he saw her disappear
Giles felt a dreadful loneliness. Tame, flat, colourless
did life become to him. The sense of Alix’s
presence had been in his mind like the sense of Alpine
flowers brought within one’s own garden precincts,
sweet, strange, yet intimate; like the sense of mountain
ranges on one’s horizon, aloof, mysterious, yet visible.
“Beautiful, darling creature,” he heard himself murmuring
as he drove home through a country that had
lost all savour. The loss of Toppie from his life was
like a pervading, half-stupefied aching; but from the
sharpness that the loss of Alix brought he saw how little
in comparison Toppie’s going meant real loss. He
had never possessed Toppie. The ache might now be
deeper, but it was still the same ache that the thought
of Toppie had always meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not seen her. None of them had seen her
again. And on the morning of Alix’s departure they
heard that she had returned to Bath. Another three
days passed before a letter came for him. It was short,
yet it brought him more comfort than he could have
believed possible.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Giles,” she wrote, “I think I begin to understand
all that you have tried to do for me. It was
wrong of you; but I think I understand. I have been
wrong, too. Perhaps this came to show me that one
can love wrongly. I do not think I love him less now;
only differently. I know that he suffered before he
died. When I read his last letters now, I can see the
suffering in them. I send my love to everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always your friend, dear Giles,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Toppie</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And a postscript, written hurriedly, ran: “Keep poor,
brave little Alix with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the dry phrases he read the mastered anguish.
But it was mastered. That was the comfort that Toppie’s
letter brought him. She had risen already above
her own sense of personal wreckage and could contemplate
its meaning. As her piercing intuition on
the day among the birch-woods had led her to the
portals of the truth, so now it had led her to its heart.
She saw at last, truly, what Giles had done; she no
longer misunderstood him. Even, perhaps, she had
begun, dimly, to understand what manner of woman
madame Vervier might be. Toppie was noble enough
for that. It would appease rather than lacerate her
heart to believe that the woman to whom Owen had
given his heart was not ignoble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the morning of Toppie’s letter that Jerry
was ushered into Giles’s study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, as he rose to greet the bright apparition in his
doorway, did not know whether it was with more
gloom or satisfaction that he saw it. He was glad that
Jerry was holding on, yet his presence there seemed to
add to his own sense of bereavement. He could do nothing
more for Alix. She had shown him that he could
do nothing more. But though she had disowned Jerry,
it now remained to be seen if Jerry could do something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she gone!” Jerry exclaimed. Giles’s face might
have told it to him and his charming eyes, so like his
mother’s, went swiftly round the room, partly as if
they might still discover the missing Alix, and partly
in the unconscious appraisal of a new <span class='it'>milieu</span>. Like his
mother, Jerry would always see everything, wherever
he might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She’s gone,” said Giles, giving a push to the
sofa. Strange, indeed, to have Alix’s suitor sitting in
Alix’s own corner; Giles was aware of a sense of relief
as Jerry did not yet take it. “It seemed the simplest
thing for her to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, then, he seemed to detect, or suspect,
a flavour of relief in the discomfiture on Jerry’s face,
but it was in immediate self-exculpation that he said,
as if Giles might call him to account: “I couldn’t get
here before; really I couldn’t. I’ve been away. I didn’t
know till yesterday that Mummy had stolen a march
on me. Mummy couldn’t hide from me—she didn’t
try to—I’ll do her that justice—how splendidly
you’ve been standing up for us.—If she’s gone, do
you mean she knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows, or has guessed enough,” said Giles. “I
don’t really think she’d have seen you if you’d got here
before. It’s three days now since she went. What she
says, you see”—and Giles again indicated Alix’s corner
to Jerry—“is that there are now insuperable objections
on both sides, and that her place is with her
mother. Do sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jerry stood for a moment longer, gazing. “Yes,
I see,” he then said. “Yes. That’s just what she
would say. But how disgusting that she should have
to say anything about it—poor little darling. Isn’t it
a miserable business,” he added, as he dropped on to
the sofa and glanced with a sort of gentle alarm at the
gas-fire, rather as though he might, unless he held himself
in, shy at it. He was making Giles, too, think of a
nervous, charming horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s very miserable in some ways,” said Giles.
He did not sit. He stood, his hands in his pockets and
leaned against the mantelpiece looking down at his
visitor. Very much like a charming horse was Jerry.
Giles could almost see him nibbling reconnoitringly at
the edge of the stained-oak mantelpiece or choosing
suddenly to take a flying leap out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry offered his cigarette-case as though it might
help them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that confounded Marigold nosing out this
story about Alix’s mother,” he said, striking his match.
“And it’s true, you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly as she put it, I gather; but true enough.
Since it is true enough, it’s better, I suppose, that it
came out as soon as possible,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I’d rather it had never come out at all,”
Jerry objected. “It makes no difference to me. I don’t
care a hang about ancestors and all that sort of thing,
and I expect we’ve plenty of rotters among our own.
It’s Mummy who takes it so hard. If only Alix had
consented to marry me at once, when I asked her, we’d
have been all right. People always put up with the
<span class='it'>fait accompli</span>, don’t they, and Mummy’s so awfully
fond of Alix. Marigold might have come trotting with
her little tale of woe, but she’d have been too late.
Well, she’s too late now, and I’ll show her so—horrid
little cat. I shall go over to Paris at once, and I don’t
suppose I shall meet with much opposition from madame
Vervier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ll meet with a great deal from Alix,” said
Giles, aware of restlessness and inquiry beneath the
brave parade of Jerry’s words. “I don’t think you’ve
a chance of marrying her against your mother’s wishes.
Your only chance is to bring your mother round. That
will take time. You’ll have to show your mother that
you mean it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry eyed him for a moment. “Well, Alix is a
French girl. She’s rubbing it in enough that she’s
French—and she’ll obey her mother. If her mother
tells her that she’s to marry me, I expect she will; and
I’m pretty sure I could get round madame Vervier. By
the way, what sort of a woman is she, really?” Jerry
added, and boyishly, touchingly in Giles’s eyes, he suddenly
flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was thinking how like wax in madame Vervier’s
hands would Jerry be. “She’s a charming
woman,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course she’s that,” Jerry assented. “But
I mean, is she a lady, all that sort of thing?—Not
that I care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles reflected. “The only person I ever met who
reminds me of her is your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mummy?” Jerry stared, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not alike at all in what they’ve done; but
they are very much alike in what they are. You could
count upon madame Vervier as you could count upon
your own mother. She’d always know what to do. If
you and Alix married, she’d never trouble you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean she’d give up Alix if it was for her happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely. What she wants most is Alix’s happiness.
Your difficulty wouldn’t be at any time with
madame Vervier, but with Alix herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wouldn’t give her mother up, you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what you know of her, do you think she
would?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry turned his eyes upon the fire and contemplated
it. “She’s awfully young,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but she won’t change, in that respect, in getting
older. It would be difficult. Alix’s feeling for her
mother would make it all very difficult. You’d have to
face that, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry had never had to face anything that was difficult.
Everything about him seemed to be saying that
as he sat there, his thoughtful cigarette in his hand, his
russet head poised meditatively. He saw Alix as a
bright object that he naturally wanted, and now it was
shown to him that, bright as she might be, darkness
lay about her. It was evident to Giles that he turned
away from the thought of darkness as he said presently:
“Isn’t she absolutely the loveliest creature
you ever beheld?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” Giles confessed, surprised by the
change of theme, but willing to follow to the best of his
ability, “I’ve never thought much about Alix’s appearance.
I don’t suppose one does when one has
known someone from a child. I suppose she is lovely.
I like everything her face means; and the more I know
Alix the more it goes on meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a Nike,” said Jerry, gazing at the fire. “She’s
on the prow of a Greek ship flying over the wine-dark
sea. You’ve seen her dance—in that white and crystal
dress with the silver round her head—it’s like the
rhythm of Shelley’s Hymn of Pan. When I look at her
dancing, I long to dance with her; when I dance with
her, I long to be looking at her. Odd, isn’t it, how one
never can get enough at once. She’s got the most extraordinarily
cold eyes, you know,” said Jerry, fully
launched upon his theme. “Even when one’s dancing
with her and looks down into them;—she’s so happy,
she smiles up at you—and yet they are as cold, as
blue, as deep as mountain lakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet she’s not cold,” said Giles. He was seeing Alix
as Jerry spoke about her eyes, not dancing, not smiling,
but looking as she had looked the other morning
when she had said: “Now, if other things should fail
her, she will know at least I am there to be depended
upon.” With the words he had seen her go forward to
take her mother by the hand. A tenderness, passionate,
enfolding, had thrilled beneath the quiet words. How
right had madame Vervier been in believing that she
could count always upon Alix.—And Jerry only saw
her dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he himself wanted Alix to dance. He wanted her
to marry Jerry. He believed that it might still be possible
if Jerry could be good enough. “If you hold on,
you know,” he said—and Jerry could not think it
irrelevant—“I feel sure your mother will stand by
you, and if she stands by you, everything will fall into
place and you and Alix can go on dancing. So hold
on. Deserve her. I’m standing by you already, as
you know.” He smiled down at Jerry, so young, so
slight, but so charming and so sound. If Jerry could
get strength enough to hold on, he would waft Alix far
away. Philosophers could have little to do with dancing
white and silver Nikes. “Deserve her, you see,”
he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not go over to-morrow, you mean?” Jerry questioned,
looking up at his host, docile to any suggestion.
“I’d so much rather have it settled straight off. And
I have a feeling that if I could get at Alix over there,
with her mother to help me, I should get it settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you wouldn’t. And nothing would unsettle
your own mother so much. You’ll gain everything
with Alix, and with your mother, if you show
them that you can wait. Write to Alix, of course;
write constantly. Tell her all about it; your feelings,
you know, and what you think about her eyes.—You
both care for the same things: riding; out of doors;
fancy-dress balls, and the ‘Hymn of Pan.’ What
you’ve got to uphold, you see, Jerry, what you’ve got
to justify, is our English conception of being in love.
You must overbear convention; you must break down
parental scruples. You must show yourself so much in
love to Alix that you’ll convince her that romance is
common-sense. You see, I want you to win her, not
only for yourself, but for England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s eyes were on him while he spoke and they
dwelt for some moments of bright contemplation as if
for the first time he was looking at Giles more carefully
than he had looked at the gas-fire and the mantelpiece.
“You know, if I may say so, I do think you’re a very
remarkable person,” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I? Why?” Giles asked, smiling rather sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well”—Jerry continued to look at him, but he
blushed again—“to care so much about a girl you’re
not in love with yourself. Doing everything for her.
I’ve heard a lot about you, you may be sure. Alix
thinks more of you than of anybody in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, too, was blushing now. “Does she?” he said.
They were suddenly two boys together, and as they
spoke of love and of Alix their words, to Giles, seemed
to lift her far away out of childhood and to set her, a
woman, between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m most awfully fond of Alix,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. That’s what’s so remarkable,” said Jerry,
shyly smiling. “To be so fond, yet not to be in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Giles found himself offering, really as if
in a sort of exculpation, “one may be in love with
someone else; that would prevent, wouldn’t it? And
you can care immensely about someone without being
in love with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could one? When she’s Alix? I can’t imagine it,”
Jerry a little nervously smiled. “Unless, as you suggest,
there’s someone else, and then I shouldn’t have
time to care so much for another girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry’s ingenuous analysis certainly had its potency;
Giles did not quite know what to say to him. “Even
if I had been, it wouldn’t have done me any good,”
he suggested. “Alix would never have thought of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you mustn’t ask <span class='it'>me</span> to say that she would!”
Jerry laughed out at this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up as he spoke and went to the mantelpiece,
picking up and examining one of the horrid little china
animals thereon. But he was not seeing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England will get her in a much more satisfactory
way, for Alix, than it would if I were in the running,”
said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you really think it may get her; you really
think I can manage it,” Jerry murmured, still examining
the china cow. Jerry, more than ever, because he
saw him as so remarkable, was depending upon him
for sustainment. It would have been a comparatively
easy matter for him to leap over the barriers and make
off to the beloved. To wait, to hold on, was a different
matter, and Giles knew a little turn of fear as he saw it.
It was no good Jerry’s thinking that anyone else could
hold on for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t manage it unless you can count on yourself,”
he now informed him. “There’s nobody else for
you to count on. Alix is against you, and your mother
is against you. It won’t be an easy thing to marry
Alix. It’s not only as a dancing Nike you have to
think of her. It’s as madame Vervier’s daughter, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as a Catholic. And as French,” Jerry murmured,
setting down the cow to take up the cat. “You
know she said—funny little darling—that the children
would have to be Catholics. Not that I’d care a
rap.—Only, it does somehow make everything more
difficult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly does. Alix has all her objections.
Nothing could be more difficult,” Giles rather heavily
assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as the English lover it’s up to me to overcome
them; show her that I can carry her off in spite of
them—in spite of herself—what? How would you
like it if your children had to be Catholics?” Jerry
very gloomily inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles did not have to reflect for long. “I should not
like it at all. It’s one of the things I’d put up with if I
were in love with Alix and she in love with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, I almost wish you were,” Jerry now
said, and he spoke from a sudden cloud of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles paused. “Does that mean that you’ve given
her up?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ve not given her up.” Jerry looked down at
the china cat. “I’m going to try to live up to the part
of the English lover. It’s only,” said Jerry, “that I see
the difficulties.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Before Giles went back to Oxford a short letter came
to Mrs. Bradley from Toppie saying that she was going
to stay on in Bath for the present and that her determination
to become a nun was unaltered. After that,
for many weeks, he heard nothing more of her, and it
was not until the end of June that he received a letter
telling him that she was at Headington, staying with
an old friend of her mother’s before entering her novitiate,
and asking him to come and see her. The old
friend lived in a little house sunken among the high
walls and deep leafage of a garden, and the drawing-room,
where Giles waited for Toppie, its long windows
opening on a little lawn, seemed part of the garden, it
was so full of flowers and sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood at a window and looked out and listened
to a garden-warbler singing ceaselessly, like a running
brook, among the branches. His heart was full of
presage, for he had not seen Toppie since the dreadful
day that had severed them from the past. Yet the
song of the garden-warbler, rippling incessantly over
his fear, seemed to dissolve it into a happy melancholy.—“The
past is over, not forgotten, but over, over,”—the
song seemed to be saying. “This sweetness,
this sunlight, this tranquillity is the present. Believe in
it, live in it, as I do. She is not angry with you any
longer. You have not failed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Toppie entered, he saw that she was not
angry and that he had not failed. More than that;
there was much more than that for him in Toppie’s
face; but he could not at first determine what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was changed. So changed that it was almost as
if he had forgotten her and was seeing her for the first
time again. Perhaps it was that since last seeing her
all his thoughts of her had been changed. Personal
hopes, personal longings, were gone, and seen without
the aching glamour that they had cast about her Toppie
was at once less and more beautiful. For never before
had he recognized the defects and deficiencies of
her face. She was a pale, thin, freckled girl, slightly
featured, with dry lips and colourless eyes. Yet in
this newly perceived earthliness there was revealed to
him the fulfillment, as it were, of that celestial quality
he had from the first divined in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was what Toppie was; this was the material
that had been given her to work upon; and it was as if
he saw her, through the power of prayer, lifting from
cold and arid soil flowers and fruit to heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him sweetly and calmly giving him
her hand, and saying: “Dear Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad.—I’ve so hoped you would see me,”
Giles murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I was to see you. It only wanted a little
time—to settle things,” said Toppie. “Let us go into
the garden. Isn’t it the dearest garden?—I used to
come here sometimes when I was a child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it all settled?” Giles asked, as they went out and
walked along a grass path to the shade of a lilac-tree.
“I mean about the convent; about your leaving us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all settled.—But we don’t think of it like
that, you know,” said Toppie. “We think it’s to be
much nearer you, really.—And then, of course, I
shall be able to see you all sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down under the lilac-tree. It was in thick
bloom and the fragrance fell about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles saw now what his greatest fear had been. And
he knew that it was groundless. Toppie would never
ask him a question. The past was over; not forgotten;
but over. That was what her departure, her silence,
had won for them. She could not, at that past time,
have kept herself from pressing against the swords of
every fullest realization. She could not have kept herself
from seeing, as balefully as he had seen them, the
figures of Owen and madame Vervier. She would never
ask those questions now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently it was of Owen himself that she was
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to tell you what peace it has given me,
Giles, to feel that he did love me,” she said. The soft
sweet flowers of the lilac were behind her head, the
shadowy green of its leaves. He seemed to see, as
her eyes dwelt on him, what Toppie would look like as
a very old nun. Not so different from now. Nuns had
changeless faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loved me,” she said. “But not as I loved him.
When one accepts the truth, Giles, it gives peace. And
now I see that we are not meant to ask for the same
love back. It is enough to love; and I shall always love
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He always loved you, Toppie,” Giles murmured.
“He was swept away.” After he had said these words
he remembered that they were the words of madame
Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Toppie accepted quietly. “Swept away.
And he was alone; in a strange country; in a time of
dreadful strain. And she was so kind and so lovely.—And
she does not believe the things we believe—I
have seen it all, Giles. I have forgotten nothing of all
that you tried to tell, to explain to me on that day.
Wrong, you said, not wicked. And Alix is her child.—I
have seen it all—and how he suffered. He has
suffered, Giles,” said Toppie, looking deeply at him.
“But now, with him, too, there is peace. I believe it.
With all that has come between, we are not separated,
he and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking into Toppie’s eyes, Giles could not but believe
it, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a little while. Then Toppie
said: “And you, dear Giles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Oh, I’m getting on quite nicely, Toppie, dear,”
Giles smiled back at her. “I shall take my First, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But I didn’t mean you only, you alone. I
mean you and Alix. What are you going to do with our
dear little Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there’s a long story there,” said Giles. “Have
you heard anything about Jerry Hamble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only what your mother wrote about some trouble
that Alix felt it better to be away from.—I knew it
could not be only that. I knew what other trouble
there was.—Oh, Giles—I was so cruel to Alix.—I
could not think of what I said.—But tell me about
Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles found, when he began to tell her about Jerry
and Alix, that it was not easy. There were still things
that he must hide from Toppie. It was, he knew,
everything to her to believe that Owen had given his
heart to a woman not ignoble. But with all the celestial
charity that had come to her vision of life, how
could she believe madame Vervier anything but ignoble
if she knew of Owen’s successor? “Lady Mary
heard things about her, you see,” he said. “She heard
the things we know, Toppie. Madame Vervier has
made them easy to hear, and Lady Mary felt that
since it was so Alix wasn’t a possible person for her son
to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought she loved Alix,” Toppie said. She
was not thinking of madame Vervier and the things
Lady Mary had heard. She was thinking of Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles knew again the flavour of his old bitterness.
“She doesn’t love her enough. Perhaps one shouldn’t
expect it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one does expect it. And does he love her
enough?” asked Toppie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stopped to meditate. He had often to meditate
over Jerry. “I see a lot of him, you know,” he said
presently. “He’s always coming to me. I think he regards
me as their tutelary deity. He shows me all her
letters—I think he’d be quite willing to show me his.—Yes,
they write to each other. Alix writes one letter
to his four, Jerry complains, and her letters are models
of deportment. They might be read aloud to anybody.
Yes;—he loves her quite enough, if she’d have him
now, against his parents’ wishes. It’s waiting that’s so
hard for Jerry. He needs to do things on the crest of
the wave, and Alix keeps him in the trough. He gets
absolutely no encouragement from Alix. Thus far and
no farther, is what all her letters really say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help feeling that he isn’t good enough for
Alix, Giles,” said Toppie. “He’s too young and light
and gay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Giles stopped to think. “I don’t say he’s good
enough. But who is good enough for Alix? She’s stuff
in her for two, and lightness and gaiety are in her blood
as well as the things Jerry lacks. Jerry could make her
very happy. That’s what I’m quite sure of, Toppie.
I want him for her, and I shouldn’t want him unless I
believed he could make her happy.—For who is good
enough, really, for our little Alix?” Giles repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie had listened to him, her eyes looking out
over the garden. Now, turning them on him with a
smile, she said quite suddenly: “You are good enough.
You must marry Alix, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How strange it was. Madame Vervier had said almost
those words only a year ago and they had wakened
not an echo in him. Now, as he heard them spoken in
Toppie’s confident voice a great confusion of fear, pain,
loneliness started up in Giles’s heart. It was as if he
had been waiting for Toppie to say them; as if he had
felt that deep-toned bell hanging in some sanctuary of
his nature and known that Toppie would thus strike
upon it, sending the reverberations far into the past
as well as into the future. For a moment he could
hardly think, he was so deafened by the clamour, and
then the first words that came were helpless words:
“She wouldn’t have me, Toppie, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” smiled Toppie. She had taken his
avowal quite for granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she loves anyone, it’s Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t marry,” said Toppie. “There are too
many difficulties; and he doesn’t love her enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he does, if he’s helped. It’s someone like
Jerry she needs; someone young and gay, with things
to offer her. I’ve nothing to offer Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your love. No one will ever love Alix as
you do.” Toppie’s loving eyes scanned his face while
her confident voice thus assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s no reason, for her.—She’ll have other
people’s love. It’s true, dear Toppie; of course. I
see it’s true; and I suppose I’ve known it for a long
time. But Alix would never think of me like that. She
thinks of me as her brother. She thinks of me as her
father, almost; as someone kind and gruff and paternal.
Alix is the fairy princess, and I’m just the good old
beast who carries her around on my back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairy princesses marry the good old beast and then
he turns into a fairy prince,” said Toppie. “You’re so
much more of a fairy prince already, Giles, than you
imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she has her full-fledged fairy prince waiting
ready to fly off with her. He may have his defects; but,
all the same, he is the real thing. He can give her the
crystal dress and the prancing steed and the dancing
to flutes and cymbals.—Oh, you know perfectly well,
Toppie, darling, all the things I can never give her and
that she loves with all her heart. It’s queer, you know;
I’ve wanted so to make Alix over into something more
English, and what I see is that she’s made me into
something more French. I’d have been indignant at
the idea of fairy princes two years ago; and at marriages
with an object of advantage in them;—but
now I’ve been inoculated with a drop of the French
realism. Alix accepts the world and sees it as it is in a
way that you and I, Toppie, and people of our sort,
never could. And she’s made me worldly for her. I see
the advantages for her, and I want her to have them.
She’s not a romantic English girl. She’d never believe
in all for love and the world well lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toppie was considering him. “You say she’s made
you more French. It’s true that you understand things
you never could have understood before.—You
know how horribly afraid your understanding made
me once.—But as I listen to you it seems to me that
you are the most English thing there is. What Frenchman
would ever do what you have done, or feel what
you feel about Alix? Isn’t it an English way of feeling
to love like that, without a thought of self?—And
Alix has shown us, shown you and me, Giles, how she
can love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Toppie, dear, I know,” Giles murmured.
“But with her it’s just because she loves me selflessly
that she’ll never love me differently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe she may. I believe she will. And what
you must do,” said Toppie, “is go over and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With Jerry in the way? I couldn’t do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him have his chance, then, first. Let him go to
France and ask her. I’m not afraid of Jerry. I feel as
if I understood Alix better than you do. May I tell you
something, Giles? You must not think me foolish, but
things seem to come to me so strangely now.—I’ve
always wanted this for you. From the first time I saw
Alix, it was what I wanted. And now, when I shut my
eyes and think of you and her, it is always together that
I see you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with my doves around you. That would
be my wedding-present to you, you know,” Toppie
smiled at him and her smile had the colour of light and
came from far distances; “all my doves, to watch over
you and Alix and keep you safe together always.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Giles did not believe in what his dear Toppie had told
him; did not believe that the fairy princess could ever
be for him; but the thought of her words hovered round
him as if her very doves sought the nest she promised.
It was impossible. He could not recall a glance or
word of Alix’s that made it seem possible; yet it
hovered. The thought of Alix accompanied his days.
He had said that he had nothing to give her and it was
true that he had no fairy-prince gifts; but sculling
quietly on the Cherwell at evening, Giles, resting on
his oars and watching his beloved Oxford glide past,
would remember how many things they had shared together,
simple, happy things, the gifts of life that were
there for everybody to share. She had liked Oxford,
too, when she had last come. He treasured every discerning
phrase that his memory could recover. She
had said that it was kinder than anything in France;
and the simile of the humane old bishop, with his ring
and robes and benignant face, came back to him, and
how one day, when they read “The Scholar Gipsy”
together, she had said: “It seems to me that learning
is happier with you than with us, Giles, and goes with
happier things.—Some day you will take me for all
those walks your gipsy took.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he could see himself and Alix in Oxford together
and walking in Oxfordshire and Berkshire fields
and lanes. More than that. There was another figure
that Toppie had not brought into her picture; but she
would have thought of it. It was the figure that stood
between Alix and all those other dreams he had woven
round her and Jerry. Who but himself could care for
Alix’s mother and accept her into his life? Madame
Vervier, he knew, would never have come to Oxford.
He need not, disconcertingly, try to see her there. But
there were the long holidays when he and Alix might
have gone to her. Who but he could have kept Alix’s
mother near her? “But it’s only dear Toppie’s dream,”
thought Giles, watching the towers glide by. “And
there’s Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late one evening, at the end of Commemoration
Week, that Jerry burst into his rooms. Ruth and
Rosemary and his mother had just left him. Ruth and
Rosemary were now old enough to join in any of the
Oxford festivities that he could offer them, and his
mind was in a daze from the mid-Summer excitement.
It bubbled at the bottom of the glass like froth after
a long satisfying draught, for he knew that he had done
well in his exams and now only his viva lay before him;—so
that the wreathed, dancing heads of young girls,
and the sun-browned heads of youths on the river,
glided past on a queer background of metaphysics. He
has seen Jerry dancing, and he had seen him on the
river. Lady Mary had waved to him from a barge in
mild, unallusive affectionateness, and for a moment
they had spoken together in the crowd leaving the
Sheldonian.—“I think you could tell me that I
might be proud of Jerry,” was what she had said, and
it was a very odd thing for Lady Mary to say. It
showed Giles that if to him Jerry showed his weakness,
to his mother he was showing his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was neither strength nor weakness that Jerry
showed him now. All that Giles could read in his headlong
face was immense perplexity, and he cried at once
on entering: “I’ve had a most amazing letter from
Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles pulled himself up in his chair and Jerry sat
down on the edge of the table beside him. It was a
painful perplexity; humiliation; bitterness; cogitation
were mingled in it, and as Giles saw it fear rose in his
heart, though he asked, “Well?” with the voice of the
friend and counsellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going over in a fortnight,” said Jerry. “I
wrote and told her so. And I told Mummy, and
Mummy has behaved splendidly. She’s in a frenzy
underneath, no doubt; but she shows nothing. I expect
she relies on Alix to back her up. Well, by Jove, she
may! Alix does more than back her up. Here’s her
answer. Am I really dished, do you think?” cried
Jerry, “or is it just to put me off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles read. Alix wrote in English as if to make herself
more clear.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Jerry</span>: You must not come. I have told you
that I could not marry you, but I blame myself because
I spoke that time in the Spring with some uncertainty.
It is not only the objections now. There is another
reason that did not then exist. Please do not question
me; and please forgive me for any pain that I may
cause you, but it is someone else that I love. I did not
know what love was when you asked me. You must
marry some girl of your own race, dear Jerry, and be
happy. I shall never leave France now.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Your friend,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Alix</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Giles read, and his heart stood still while brightly,
balefully the fox-seraph visage of André de Valenbois
rose before him. Alix’s letter was dated from Vaudettes-sur-Mer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry was watching him. “Now isn’t that rather
thick,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Giles, gazing at the letter, found no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must, of course, be some Frenchman,” said
Jerry. “Can you imagine who it is? Have you heard
anything at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does her mother know any decent men?” Jerry
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles folding the letter tried to think. Were they
decent men? Judged by the world’s standards, André
de Valenbois was as decent as Jerry himself. The difference
was that he would not be decent for Alix.
“Yes,” he said, then, slowly. “I suppose they are quite
decent. Only Frenchmen are different, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt Jerry scanning his face. “You mean that no
decent Frenchman would think of marrying her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Giles felt as if he clutched Alix back from a
danger. She might have betrayed herself to him; he
could not bear to see her betrayed to Jerry. “She may
marry someone quite decent, you see, but not of her
own class. Some nice young artist, for instance, some
<span class='it'>savant</span>. Her mother knows all sorts of interesting
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she doesn’t say anything about marrying,”
Jerry persisted. “It doesn’t somehow sound like getting
married, does it? She’d tell his name if it was
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know. Not at once; not to you, so
soon. It may be only coming on between them. Nothing
definite may yet have been said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know French girls were allowed to have
things come on,” said Jerry. “I thought it was arranged
for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we may have changed Alix about all that,”
said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerry at this was silent. He sat on the table and
swung his leg. The letter lay beside him where Giles
had put it, and after a little while he picked it up and
read it over again. “Do you think she’s telling the
truth?” he then questioned. “Isn’t it still possible
that it’s all her pride? If Mummy could have written
to say I was coming and that she gave me her blessing—mightn’t
it have been different?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles for a moment contemplated the hope. Then
he rejected it. “It sounds to me like the truth,” was
all that he could find. It sounded to him too horribly
like the truth. Something dry and cold breathed
through Alix’s few words, and to his apprehension it
was the dryness, the coldness of her despair. For if
Alix knew that she loved her mother’s lover, what
must not her despair be? Only one gleam of ugliest
hope he suddenly saw and clung to;—in that case
would she not have snatched at any refuge; would she
not in that case have married Jerry on any terms, if
only in order to escape her jeopardy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles felt himself swinging in the void. How could
one tell what was at the bottom of Alix’s letter? Was
it not even possible that, with all the revelations that
had overpowered her, she had not yet thought of her
mother as involved further than with Owen? Might
she not think of the truth, to which he had helplessly
assented when she had asked him for it, as applying
only to the past? Might she not still have her ignorances?
Madame Vervier would have done all in her
power to preserve them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not thinking of himself or of Jerry. He was
thinking only of Alix, and his absorption was so deep
and so bitter that he was not aware how long Jerry,
sitting there beside him, had been observing him, until,
looking up, he met his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty sickening, isn’t it?” said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles did not quite know to which aspect of the disaster
he referred, but he assented. “Yes, it’s pretty
sickening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw that Jerry referred to his disaster. “I’m
not an utterly blind and complacent young donkey,”
said Jerry, swinging his foot, while his voice trembled
a little. “You mind as much as I do; and you mind
more, because you really love her more. Whatever you
may have been in the Spring, you’re in love with Alix
now, and I must say that I call it a rotten shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy!” Giles ejaculated, faintly smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have stood by and helped us. You’d have
helped us to the end; I see that,” said Jerry. “And
you’d have been satisfied in feeling her safe, in feeling
that England had got her, even if you hadn’t. And now
you’ve lost even that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Giles. There was
really no use in denying anything to Jerry; but at the
same time this was the final bitterness. He had never
been so sure of wanting Jerry for Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps there’s still some hope,” he said suddenly.
“I’ll have to go over, of course, as soon as I’ve had my
viva, and see whether there’s any hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean for me or for you?” Jerry inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean for you,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d make her happier than I should,” said Jerry,
swinging his foot and looking a little as if he might cry.
“You’re much more the ideal English lover than I am.
Carry her off from him; for yourself.—It’s only what
I deserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s anyone in England that Alix could have
fallen in love with, it’s you. And it’s the person she can
be in love with who can make her happiest. That’s our
English belief, isn’t it?” said Giles. “I am in love with
Alix, Jerry. It’s perfectly true. But it’s you I want
her to marry. And I’ve never felt so sure of it as
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m living up to your ideal, what? Well, I’d like to
do that, you know. I like you to think me worthy of
her even if I’m not. I leave it in your hands, then,”
said Jerry, getting off the table and turning his head
away while he stared before him. “I’m such a silly
rotter that I want her a great deal more, now that I
know she may really be in love with someone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless”—Giles had got up, too, and was gazing
intently at his young friend—“unless Jerry, after all,
you went yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I leave it to you.” Jerry shook his head, moving
to the door. “I leave it to you and Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know; I don’t know,” Giles pondered. “It
might be better. I kept you back before. That may
have been my grievous mistake. I don’t believe in
wooings by proxy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I didn’t make much headway when I wooed
in person,” Jerry remarked. “No. Clear away the
other fellow if you can. And then we’ll see. After all”—Jerry
had actually got outside now, but he put his
head around the door to utter these last words—“you’ve
never asked her yourself yet. She’s never
seen you as a lover.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, as he leaned out of the train, almost expected
to see the white form of madame Vervier awaiting him
on the platform as she had awaited him and Alix last
year. His heart then had been like a load in his side,
and how much heavier was the clogging weight upon it
now; but, from the fact that his sensations were so
much the same, all the pageant of last year’s arrival
was summoned back into his memory with its climax
in Hélène Vervier’s uplifted gaze. But she was not
there. On the sunny platform it was Alix and André de
Valenbois who stood side by side looking towards the
train, and Giles knew that it was sheer terror that he
felt as he saw them there together. Something in their
stillness, their silence, made part of it. Tall and white
they stood, side by side, and in their demeanour he read,
with the sharp intuition of a first impression, the curious
quality of a constraint that expressed at once familiarity
and withdrawal. They stood so still because they
did not care to stroll up and down together, and they
were silent because there was nothing that they could
say. Was it already as bad as that? Giles asked himself,
feeling the hot blood of the surmise beating up into his
neck and mounting to his face as he turned to pick up
his bag and gather his coat over his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it was as bad as that, André, at all events, could
assume his old air of unclouded radiancy. His eyes
knew no shadow; his voice no hesitancy. Delicate,
sweet, sharp, able to do what he liked, with himself and
others, he was ready for any encounter, and Giles even
imagined, as he stepped down before them, a touch of
sullen anger running a darker vein along the heat in his
blood, that André looked upon his English friend as
offering little complexity or difficulty. With people
so simple, so guileless, so ridiculous—for would not
André see him as rather ridiculous?—nothing more
was really needed than a light hand on the rein and the
easiest of eyes on the landscape. They would go just
where one wished and see as much or as little as one
intended them to see. “Not so simple as you think,
perhaps, my friend,” Giles was saying to himself. But
to know that he might see things that André would not
suspect him of seeing did not exercise the sickness in
his blood. At the same time, underneath everything, he
was astonished, in a side glance as it were, to see that
he was not hating him; was still feeling him charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we all are, then, again. What a triumph over
destiny!” was what André was saying—and it was on
him that Giles kept his eyes. He felt that he must
pull himself well together before looking at Alix.—“I
never expect happy things to repeat themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more they do,” thought Giles. But he could
play up. “Is it all the same as last year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly the same; but for the absence of Jules.
Even your old friend madame Dumont survives and is
eagerly awaiting your arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still there, is she?” said Giles. “I’m not surprised.
Unhappy things, at all events, repeat themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” laughed André, “your standard is too high.—I,
more easily contented, should count the old lady
a very amusing piece of bric-à-brac. We must have a
furnished world, you know.—There is room for all
sorts of oddities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No room at all, for that sort, in my world,” Giles
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking, Alix between them, to the car
outside and he could glance at her. Rather than the
constraint he had guessed at it was now the cold dignity
of complete self-mastery her profile showed him.
He knew that she had smiled at him—and had it not
been with her old sweetness?—when he had greeted
her; but he felt, as they went thus together, he, she,
and André, that chasms lay between him and Alix.
Seas lay between them; race and tongue. Her voice
came back to him as she had said, last year when he
had found her again, “But I am French.” Only it was
so much more now just that old difference. Her calm
could not hide from him how much more it was that
lay between them. And what did it hide from André?
How was it possible, if deep instinct or the new knowledge
of her mother’s life had not armed her against
him, that she should not love him? Jerry was a boy
beside him; beside the power of André’s beautifully
possessed, beautifully balanced experience, Jerry
would always seem a boy. He remembered, snatching
still at hope, that Alix had found such completeness
<span class='it'>agaçant</span>; but then she might not really like him even
now. It might be some helpless hereditary strain that
had brought her, her young heart proudly pruned of
its first happy buddings, under the spell of the love
that monsieur de Maubert had defined on the distant
Summer day; the love that burns itself out and that
may have nothing to do with liking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had said no word as yet, but as they emerged
into the sunny <span class='it'>place</span> she remarked that she had to buy
a <span class='it'>baba-au-rhum</span> for tea and asked André to drive them
across to the <span class='it'>pâtissier’s</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix is sad,” André observed when she had disappeared
into the little shop, where cakes blandly masked
in chocolate, cakes touched with rosettes of pistachio,
cakes crusted over their glitter with crisp nuts, were
placed enticingly on crystal stands in the window.
“Her cat was run over yesterday by a motor. The very
ugly cat;—you know him well, of course. It was an instantaneous
death, but her mother says that she takes
it much to heart. <span class='it'>Elle a un gros chagrin</span>,” said André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Blaise dead.—Oh, I’m sorry,” said Giles.
But he drew a dim comfort from the news. There might
be other and more childish reasons for Alix’s aloofness.
He knew how remote and stern she could look when
controlling tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that Alix was grown up, now that she was so
obviously a beautiful young girl, he noted that André
made no comments on her appearance, though it was
hardly likely that he would remark it less. It was
courageous of madame Vervier to have them there together;
though, in spite of the fear he had seen so
plainly in her, it might well be that the special fear had
never occurred to her. Sitting there in the French sunlight,
Giles felt again his old sense of astonishment
that such computations should, so inevitably, on this
soil, occur to him; that he should feel himself, with
whatever moral bitterness, accepting situations that
could hardly, in England, present themselves to his
imagination. He felt himself immersed in madame
Vervier’s <span class='it'>milieu</span>; he felt himself implicated, for was one
not implicated when one still felt all its members
charming? But one could not pretend to understand
the French unless one recognized in such situations the
workings of a drama to them commonplace. That
special terrible <span class='it'>roman-à-trois</span> of mother, lover, and
daughter, might not arise among the <span class='it'>bien pensants</span> of
the nation; but the <span class='it'>bien pensants</span> themselves would accept
it as a commonplace. They all accepted love as a
devastating natural force, overriding, where no barriers
of creed were there to withstand it, the scruples and
inhibitions of taste and principle. They all saw love,
unless it were the duly stamped and docketed love of
the Church, as <span class='it'>Vénus toute entière à sa proie attachée</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with this moral difference there went the difference
in everything;—the sunlight and the shadows,
the streets, the houses, and the people. Sunlight and
shadows were blue-and-gold, strong and deep, and the
forms they defined revealed, under their spell, a classic
harmony. The people passing, intent on business, or
sitting in front of the cafés, at ease in idleness, saw
idleness and work as two quite different things, not to
be confused; each yielding its own savour, its own
satisfaction. The sense of savour, of satisfaction everywhere;
of life as its own justification. The very smell,
warm, golden, balmy, wafted towards him from the
<span class='it'>pâtissier’s</span> was such as no pastry-cook’s shop in England
could ever yield; a dank surmise of suet and strong
tea would there hang about it and none of the cakes
would give one the same confidence of tasting as good
as they looked. Why was it, Giles wondered, as Alix
came out with her flat-bottomed, cone-shaped, snowy
little parcel, saying as she stepped in beside him: “It
is in honour of your arrival, Giles, the <span class='it'>baba</span>. Maman
remembered that you liked them last summer.”—For
no girl in England would look like Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not only that she spoke and moved as they
did not and that her clothes were differently adjusted.
These signs were only the expression of a deeper divergence.
Her face, still almost the face of a child, had,
notwithstanding, an almost alarming maturity. It was
at once more primitive and more civilized than English
faces, but the primitiveness was nothing shapeless or
unpredictable; it was preserved and used; it was, perhaps,
only a deeper layer of civilization. Druidess or
Roman virgin, who could tell which underlay the
something resistant, enduring, in the structure of her
head, sweet in glance as an Alpine flower, remote and
inaccessible as the mountain?—and, glancing at her
as she sat beside him, Giles could gauge something of
the change in his own feeling towards her by the fact
that he was afraid of Alix. Not only that; France had
already done more to him; for it was as if he were afraid
of himself, too. As they sped out into the radiant landscape
and he felt the breeze blow strong and sweet from
the sea, he was aware of currents of strange feeling in
the tide which bore him; bitter, dark, delicious, and
tumultuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am dreadfully sorry about Blaise,” he said—“André
was telling me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Alix, looking down at her parcel, “it is
sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The comfort is that he had a very happy life,” said
Giles, feeling foolish, for indeed he was not thinking of
poor Blaise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never feel that a comfort,” said Alix. “I think
it most sad of all; that happiness should end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Giles found no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you taken your degree, Giles?” Alix inquired,
with the air of leaving an untimely subject.
“Are you now a distinguished philosopher?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve taken my First all right,” said Giles.
“I’ve done pretty well. Next term will see me settled
in Oxford. But it will need a great many years, I am
afraid, to make me distinguished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where will you live?” Alix inquired. “Still in
the same rooms, high up, looking at those rather sad
grey stones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shall be a Fellow of my College and have
rather beautiful rooms; quite a vast sitting-room looking
on a beautiful garden. I’ll be rather a swell. You’ll
be surprised when you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am glad of that,” said Alix, smiling and passing
by his allusion to her return. “And there, in the
beautiful rooms, you’ll teach philosophy for the rest of
your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I expect I shall. And write it, you know; and
play cricket, and sing in the Bach choir. Sometimes
I’ll go up to London and see pictures and a play; in the
Summers I’ll walk round the Cornish coast or climb
Welsh mountains. It’s just the life that suits me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It will suit you admirably,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>André, white against the blue, drove in front of them
and, turning his head, smiling, he now observed: “Alix
has been reading philosophy of late. She must tell you.
She has been reading Bergson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find him interesting, but I’m afraid that I do not
understand him,” said Alix, and Giles saw that she
slightly flushed as André thus addressed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s far too difficult to begin on,” said Giles.
“He’s not for the beginning at all; he’s for the very
end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought that was just his point, that he
started at the very beginning,” said Alix—“with
germs, or atoms, or small things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, those are the things one should end with,”
Giles assured her, “because, you see, they are the furthest
away from us. The beginning is an idea, and the
end is an atom. You can’t understand an atom, that is,
until you understand an idea. If you’ll come to Oxford
and let me teach you, I’ll land you safely in Bergson
after three years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I shall read no more philosophy,” said Alix.
“I shall not go as far as ideas or atoms in either direction.
I shall stay in between. All the nicest things are
in between, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo! Bravo!” André smiled round at her, and
Giles could not interpret his smile. Alix did not reply.
She turned her head and looked out over the plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vaudettes-sur-Mer in its palisades of trees was before
them now, painted in delicate washes of colour
against the sky. “It looks like the beginning of a fairy-tale,
doesn’t it,” said Giles and brought Alix’s eyes to
Vaudettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, like the place children find on the front page,”
she said. “And a happy fairy-tale, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it can’t have the real fairy-tale pang and
flavour to you,” said Giles. “It’s a place I find, but
can never keep. You wake up to it and I wake up out
of it. It’s my dream and your reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can keep it, Giles, as much as the Cornish
coast, or the Welsh mountains,” smiled Alix, “as much
as we keep it, really;—for it is our fairy-tale, too.—You
have only to come back and find us in it,” said
Alix, and, while she looked before her steadily, he almost
thought he saw a hint of tears in her eyes, as
though what he said of her loved Vaudettes touched
her too deeply. Did she see in it the fairy-tale place of
childhood never to be regained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, as it had been last year at Les Chardonnerets,
a blue and golden day. The gulls were floating
past on a level with the cliff-top and on the verandah
were monsieur de Maubert and madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had passed through the wind-bent thickets and
seen the sunny flags with their oleanders and smelt
again the fairy-tale smell Giles so passionately remembered.
But—he knew it as he came out on to the
stage, as it were, of the drama—the fairy-tale was
spoiled for ever. Madame Vervier had been its centre;
the wine-like sweetness of her smile, her Circe security,
had been its atmosphere. And now the magic was
broken. He could see nothing else as she came forward
to greet them, so lovely, lovelier than ever to his
eyes, so kind and simple, welcoming back with her
wide, enveloping gaze the friend who knew so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have watched your crossing,” said monsieur de
Maubert, as the greetings passed, “in imagination. It
has been a sea of glass. A sea for the Venus of Botticelli
on her shell.—You rise before us in a guise even
more welcome than that of the amiable goddess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur de Maubert also was changed, though
Giles had no time just then for more than a passing
glance at the recognition. He spoke with a certain
heaviness; as though he came forward to lend a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A kind young Englishman in tweeds is, I can assure
him, far more pleasing to me than any Venus ever
painted by Botticelli,” smiled madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles has become a great philosopher, Maman,”
said Alix. She untied her <span class='it'>baba</span> at the table and placed
it carefully on a plate in its little pasteboard dish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He always was a great philosopher,” smiled madame
Vervier. “He is the wisest young man, as well as
the kindest, that I have ever known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but it is now a professional wisdom as well,”
said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Albertine, with a saturnine smile of welcome for
Giles, brought out the tea and madame Vervier took
her place at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything in her loveliness was altered and, as he
looked at her, with surreptitious glances, aware, so
strangely, that André was looking at him, Giles suddenly
felt that it made him think of the alteration in
Toppie’s face. She, like Toppie, had drunk tears night
after night; she had seen the truth and been shattered
by it; and she, like Toppie, was built up again. A
drift of lilac went behind her head in his imagination
while the link so marvellously bound them together.
For had she, too, not relinquished? It was as Alix had
said it would be. She had guessed everything. Yet,
though so wan, so careful, so oppressed, she was serene.
Her strength, her security, even, was still there, but
disenchanted, turned to other uses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel it so strange that English people should be
philosophers,” she said. Giles saw that she intended
them all to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it too reasonable a pursuit for such
an irrational people as we are?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Just that. You are a people who improvise
as you go. To philosophize would have been, I should
imagine, against the genius of your race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re not all of us, all the time, lurching along
on mere instinct. We do, some of us,” said Giles,
“stop, now and then, and reflect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But lurching becomes you,” André at this put in.
“You lurch, as a rule, in the right direction—for
yourselves. Look at your Empire,” he smiled, taking
a slice of <span class='it'>baba</span>, “all made up of lurches and success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We planned to have India, you will remember,”
Alix, at this, suddenly remarked. “We planned and
even plotted it. It was only as they worked as best
they could against our plots that the English won it,
not intending to have an Indian Empire at all.—I always
like that. That always seems to me just. And
history is so seldom just.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles felt that the eyes of her mother and compatriots
were turned upon her, as she made this statement,
with a certain astonishment. “And I think it is
rather noble of those who do reflect,” Alix went on,
calmly, knowing evidently what she thought of the
question in its national and its personal applications;
“for the others, those who lurch and make the Empire,
can pay so little attention to you. It is very disinterested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We practise philosophy for our own satisfaction,
what?” Giles laughed, though aware of ambiguous
cross-currents. “I’m glad you find us noble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is quite right, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>,” André said cordially.
“You are a race of adventurers. And it is as adventurous
to reflect among a people indifferent to thought
as it is to set forth with a bundle on your back and conquer
a continent by chance. You are a people, in other
words, who do not need to see your goal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you prefer your own rationality,” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prefer it; yes. I distrust instinct; perhaps because
in our history, as mademoiselle Alix has pointed
out, we have so often been foiled by it. I don’t see it as
innocent, you know. I see it as crafty. As craftier far
than our open-eyed planning. And, apart from large
questions of national destiny, it is, I think, more comfortable
to live among a people all of whom reflect, if
only a little, and all of whom know where they want to
get to. Our horizon is more restricted, but because we
see the frame we can fit our picture into it. Life with
you, over there across the Channel, for all your charm
and force, is essentially confused and haphazard. It
goes through everything; from your younger sons,
flung out to swim or sink as best they can, to your
towns and your Shakespeare. You may, in one sense,
beat us; but in another we have, I think, the advantage.
You take in more, but you don’t know what to make
of it. To make all that can be made of the time and
space at our disposal, that is our wisdom, <span class='it'>mon cher</span>
Giles, and can there be a better one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is the time and space at our disposal?”
Giles felt Alix’s eyes upon them. He did not quite
know what he was defending or against whom he was
defending it; but it felt to him as if he were upholding
England, and all he wanted Alix to gain from England,
against all he feared for her in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What we can make use of, what we can see and
understand,” said André promptly. “It’s because of
our sobriety that we French are capable of living a life
beautiful in itself; a self-justifying life. We know how
to use life; we know how to shape it. The very workman,
sitting at midday in his café, makes a ritual of his
meal of sheep’s trotters and sour red wine. The <span class='it'>frotteur</span>
enjoys the polish he puts on the <span class='it'>parquet</span>, and the
<span class='it'>bonne</span> enjoys her bed-making and dusting. We don’t
do things because of something else; we do them because
we find them in themselves enjoyable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s true.” Giles was thinking of the French
sunlight; of monsieur de Maubert’s philosophy; of the
<span class='it'>pâtissier’s</span>. The difference went down to the very
roots of things. “We are discontented and clumsy and
romantic, compared to you; it’s our very religion to
be discontented, with ourselves and what we can see.
We are rebels; that’s what it comes to. Rebels are the
people who refuse the seen for the unseen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet who pick up the seen, in their stride, as it
were, and then don’t know what to make of it.—It
is that with which we reproach you. You spoil one
world in trying to reach the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, these are themes too profound for my tea-table,”
madame Vervier interposed, while Giles, meeting
André’s eye, felt, suddenly, something challenging,
sword-like, beneath its blue smile. “We will not pass
from history to metaphysics, if you please. Are you
tired, Giles? Will you rest? I have some letters to
write for the post. After that we might have a little
walk if you felt so inclined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles said there was nothing he would like better.
He would unpack and rest a little and then join her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in the salon with mademoiselle Fontaine
when he came down half an hour later, and on the verandah
monsieur de Maubert sat alone, heavily, Giles
still felt, in his sunny corner; not reading; looking out
at the sea. Giles was aware of feeling sorry for him;
but he did not want to talk to monsieur de Maubert.
He went out quietly at the back of the house, and wandered
through the garden, finding himself suddenly, as
he came to the gate, bareheaded, his hands in his pockets,
face to face with old madame Dumont and madame
Collet. They sat in a small wicker pony-chaise
drawn by a ruminant stout pony, and Giles inferred,
since there was only room for two that mademoiselle
Fontaine had walked beside the pony’s head, taking
her parents out thus for a peaceful airing. They waited
at the gate for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ah. C’est monsieur Gilles</span>,” madame Collet simpered.
“You remember monsieur Gilles, Maman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Dumont was not much altered. The vulture-like
poise of her head was perhaps more sunken,
and her raven eye less piercing; but a light came to it
as she saw him; an old resentment and a present
glee. “<span class='it'>Charmée, monsieur, charmée de vous revoir</span>,”
she assured him, and as her eye measured the morsel
thus presented to its greed Giles seemed to see the
vulture roused and rustling its feathers. “You are just
arrived?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles told her that he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You find your friends again,” said madame Dumont,
and there was a quaking note of hurry in the
majesty of her tones. “You will, however, find them
changed.—Ah, changes are sad; disastrous. She has
had much to bear. It tells; it tells upon her. You find
madame Vervier aged? Altered? Sadly altered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see no alteration at all,” said Giles grimly, his
eye turning on madame Collet, who murmured a low
word of protest to her mother. But madame Dumont
was not to be curbed. She leaned from the chaise and
laid her lean hand in its black silk mitt on Giles’s arm.
“<span class='it'>Il l’a lachée</span>,” she said in a harsh whisper. “<span class='it'>Il va se
marier.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maman; Maman,” madame Collet urgently whispered,
casting a helpless glance at Giles. “You must
not thus repeat gossip about our friend. Monsieur
Gilles will not know what to think of you. Do not heed
her, Monsieur.—She is so very old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are these manners! To whom are you speaking!
Old! I am old, indeed, if I must thus accept impertinences
from my daughter!” Madame Dumont
thundered, turning a terrible glance upon her child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais Maman, Maman, je ne veux pas vous offenser!</span>”
Giles heard poor little madame Collet plead
as he hastily muttered an adieu and fled from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the door he nearly collided with mademoiselle
Blanche. If madame Vervier was altered, mademoiselle
Blanche was more so. Suddenly, looking at her
chalk-white mask, glittering there in the sunlight,
Giles saw the catastrophe that had befallen them all
with a cruel sharpness that the side-issues of a situation
may sometimes display more cuttingly than its
centre. In mademoiselle Blanche’s face he read that
any reversionary hopes she might have cherished were
withered. It was not to her that André had turned.
He would never turn to her. He had been sorry for
monsieur de Maubert, sitting in his patch of sunlight;
and he was sorry now for mademoiselle Blanche. She
had a brilliant smile for him. Her scarlet mouth made
him feel sick. He promised her, did he not, to have tea
with them one day. Giles said he was afraid he had
only a very little time to spend at Les Chardonnerets
this year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have come to take mademoiselle Alix from us
again?” smiled mademoiselle Blanche, the cold flame
of her eye traversing him, so that he saw again, in a
direful flash of prescience, that in old age her eye would
be like her grandmother’s. “You once more carry off
our lovely little Persephone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How mademoiselle Blanche desired that he would!
The fear that circled round Giles fastened a tentacle in
his heart as he saw how mademoiselle Blanche, all
hopeless as she must be, feared Alix’s presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not; I’m afraid I shall have to leave her
where she wants to be—with her mother,” he said,
feeling a slow red mount to his face as he saw all the
things in mademoiselle Blanche that she did not want
him to see. For one strange shuffling moment the pretences
between them fell, and mademoiselle Blanche
looked hard at him, looked as one human being may
look at another, with deep inquiry and surmise. Then,
murmuring a hasty farewell, she fled, a white marionette,
down the path between the nasturtiums.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the verandah Alix sat beside monsieur de Maubert
reading “Bérénice,” aloud to him. André was
stretched near them in a deck-chair, his eyes following
the smoke of his cigarette, and madame Vervier
emerged from the salon, a little sheaf of letters in her
hand. She laid them down on a table and André said
that he would presently post them. “Yes. You and
I would rather go by the cliff, Giles,” said madame
Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wore a white dress, not the tennis dress; this was
fashioned differently, with floating panels and long
loose sleeves. She was bareheaded, a sunshade in her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix reads to him every afternoon,” she said as
they went towards the cliff. She spoke of monsieur de
Maubert, but her heart, Giles knew, must be shaken
by the interview with mademoiselle Blanche.—Mademoiselle
Blanche could only have come to measure
her pangs, surreptitiously, against madame Vervier’s.
“His eyes trouble him of late, <span class='it'>le pauvre cher</span>. He enjoys
hearing Alix. He is very fond of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked along the little path beaten in the
grass at the edge of the cliff. The sea was the Botticelli
sea and against the sky went a flock of young goldfinches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our birds,” said madame Vervier, pointing to them,
and he still heard the breathlessness in her voice.
What had she succeeded in concealing from mademoiselle
Blanche, and what had mademoiselle Blanche
succeeded in concealing from her? “See the pattern
made by the triangles of gold on their wings,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We call such a flock, a charm of goldfinches,” said
Giles. “Isn’t it a pretty name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A charm. A charm of goldfinches. And what a
happy name. They look that.” Madame Vervier’s
eyes followed the flight of the bright birds. “I wish
one did not have to think of snares and cages when one
sees them. Our people are so cruel for birds. I wish
such happy things might escape the snare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great many do. We shouldn’t be seeing that
charm now unless a great many escaped,” Giles tried
to smile at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is the way of life, is it not, to snare and spoil
happiness,” said madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the woods of Les Chardonnerets behind
them. Before them was the great curve of the cliff and
the empty sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, you see me punished,” said madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles walked beside her and found no word to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even you, stern moralist as you are,” madame
Vervier pursued, “could hardly have foreseen such
a punishment.—To know that I have ruined my
child’s best chance of happiness; all that I could have
hoped for her.—To know that she is suffering because
of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t think it would come like that,” Giles
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but it has come in the other way, too,” she
said, looking round at him in the pale shadow of her
sunshade;—“though I have forestalled that calamity,
and a calamity forestalled is always endurable. André
and I are parted.” Madame Vervier continued to look
at him steadily. “I have told him that this Summer is
the end. He still believes—or tries to believe—that
he loves me; but he consents. I knew that he would
consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles walked beside her filled with a confusion of
pain and pity. Never before had madame Vervier
openly admitted her relation to André; admitted it to
Owen’s brother. “He doesn’t look like partings,” was
all he found, most helplessly, to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partings, at his age, are the preludes to beginnings;
and André has the gift of looks. He is, perhaps, not
quite at ease; but he has wisdom—our French wisdom,
Giles. His mother, already, is arranging a marriage
for him. As soon as our rupture is definitely
known, he will be able to settle himself in life;—<span class='it'>se
ranger</span>,” said madame Vervier. “And he will be glad
to be settled; he will be glad to be married to a charming
young girl whom he has known since boyhood;—a
young girl,” madame Vervier continued in her steady
voice, “whom your madame Marigold met when she
came to France last Spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know all about that, then?” Giles muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I not know?” madame Vervier returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her maimed for life. Yes; it had, with André,
gone as deep as that. She had unflinchingly performed
the surgical operation, severed the limb and bound the
arteries. He saw her bandaged, spotted with blood,
drained of joy; but tranquil; moving forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was time,” she said as if to herself, looking before
her. “When Alix returned to me, when I saw
what I had done to her, I knew that it was time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not think of one thing to say to her; not one
word of comfort or approbation. He would have liked
to say that she would be happier; but he did not believe
that she would be. He would have liked to say that
she had behaved worthily; but the note of moral appraisal
was repellent to his imagination. And under
everything went that bitter memory of who André was,
and whose successor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there were further reasons for André’s acquiescence,”
said madame Vervier suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had gone for a long way in silence. A light
breeze met them, now that they had rounded a headland,
and the thin panels of madame Vervier’s dress
were blown backward as she went. Goddess-like as he
had always felt her, there was something disembodied,
unearthly in her aspect now. It was as if, gliding
through sad Elysian fields, beautiful, changeless, with
gazing eyes, she contemplated the sorrows of the past.
Yet her voice, as she spoke again, was not the voice of
an Elysian spirit. He recognized as he heard it that a
bitter humanity still beat at the heart of her confidences
and that her tranquillity was not the shining of
an inner peace, but a shield proudly worn. What she
had to tell him was the thing most difficult to tell; the
thing that throbbed and echoed in her, as the scar of
the severed limb burns and remembers; and all her
voice was altered as she spoke of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were further reasons,” she repeated, turning
her face away from him to the sea. “He knows
that it is best to go, since to remain would be to love
Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And through all his fear, Giles saw it now; he had
clung to the hope that it was an ugly dream. He
measured, in a sense of physical sickness, the difference
between an ugly dream and reality as in madame Vervier’s
words his dread was made close and palpable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But isn’t that impossible?” It was his English
voice that asked the question. His French understanding
knew that it was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so?” madame Vervier’s French voice returned.
All the acquiescence of her race spoke in it.
“Alix is exquisite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s face swam before Giles. “But she is your
daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would offend his taste. That does offend it.
That is one of the reasons, as I have said, for his consent
to our parting. It is not a reason, if he stayed, that
could repress his heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t Alix be trusted to do that?” Giles asked
after a moment. He must ask it. He must approach,
in order to know whether madame Vervier saw it, too,
the deepest fear of all. And with what a complex
thankfulness he heard in her reply that Alix’s secret
was safe with him. It did not exist for madame Vervier’s
imagination even. A deep, strange bitterness
spoke in her voice as she said: “Her dislike of him is
an added attraction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her dislike of him? Does she dislike him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you have seen it. As if by instinct. Always.
From the first. It is an added attraction,” madame
Vervier repeated; and with a little laugh, more bitter
than her voice, she said: “It is the first time in his life
that André has found himself disliked by a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How strange, how tortuous, how self-contradictory
was the human heart, Giles thought, walking beside
his unhappy friend. With all her passionate maternal
love he felt, thrilling in her tone, a resentment
against her child that she should be indifferent to the
charm that had so subjugated herself. Giles felt it
cruel to ask the further question that came to him, yet
he wondered if she had not, often, asked it of herself.
“He consents to go, then, because he is hopeless?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, indeed, often asked it. He heard that in
her voice as she answered: “Oh—do not let us deprive
him of all merit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached by now a further promontory of
the cliff and looked over a long stretch of the coast,
pale blue sea, pale cliffs, a delicate distant finger of the
land running out, against the horizon, with a tiny
lighthouse upon it. A bench was set amidst the grass
before this view and madame Vervier sank down upon
it as if exhausted. Giles sat on the grass at her feet
and for a little while they surveyed the azure scene in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said madame Vervier, and he heard
that she gathered her thoughts from dark broodings,
“let us speak no more of me, but of Alix.—Of Alix
and Jerry. For you like this Jerry. It is because of him
that you have come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s because of him. I like him very much.”
Giles looked down at the grass. “I saw him before I
left. All that he asks is to marry her at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, he loves her, I know. He is an honourable
young Englishman and he loves her. That is what I
have gone upon from the beginning. It is not Jerry
who is the difficulty. It is Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must give her time, you see,” Giles murmured.
“Her pride had such a blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give her time! I would give her anything!” madame
Vervier exclaimed. “But I can do nothing with
Alix.”—<span class='it'>Rien! rien! rien!</span> she said in French with a
crescendo of grief and impatience almost comic to his
ear for all its pathos. “You have altered my Alix for
me, you English, Giles. You have given her a different
heart. It is strange, strange to me—and bitter—to
feel how changed she is. She loves me. More than ever.
She has guessed everything, and she loves me more
than ever; but with a love almost maternal; a love
terribly mature. I could not have believed it possible
in so short a time that a child should grow to womanhood.
She is docile, still; obedient; but she does not
deceive me;—it is only in the little things—the
things that do not count. If, in the great things, she
would obey, nothing need be lost. There is now only
a <span class='it'>rangée</span> mother to explain, to efface, to avoid.—How
easy I would make it for my Alix to avoid me if her
happiness demanded it!—But, no; she will not hear
me. She is a stone to my supplications. She denies
that she has ever loved him. She takes her life into her
own hands and says that she will never marry, that she
will stay with me always and be happy so. I dash myself
against a rock in Alix. More than that;—she
watches me; she suspects me—as if I were the daughter—<span class='it'>bon
Dieu</span>!—and she the mother!—I wrote to
Jerry. I told him to come;—it was but the other day.—I
told him that it was best that they should meet,
and that I would help him. And Alix intercepted the
letter. Yes;—you may well stare. She confronted me
with it and tore it in two before my eyes. She told me
she knew too well what I had said to Jerry and that she
had herself written and that all was over between them.
Cold! Stern!—I could hardly believe it was my little
Alix.—She spoke as if I had done her a great wrong.—As
if I were the child and she the mother,” madame
Vervier repeated, a note of bewilderment mingling with
the grief of her tone; and, indeed, as she made him
these ingenuous confidences, Giles saw her as the child,
the tricking child; all the French rôles reversed and
Alix sustained in hers by what England had given her.
No wonder madame Vervier was bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that was very wrong of you,” he said, as he
might have said to the child. “You had no right to do
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No right! I, her mother, am to sit by with folded
hands and watch her ruin herself! Those are your
English ideas. Those are the ideas that Alix has made
hers. She, too, said I had no right. As if a mother’s
right over her child’s life were not supreme!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t think it is, you see. Not when the child
has reached Alix’s age. You don’t want her to marry
a man she does not love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love! Why should she not love him, since she
loves nobody else!” cried madame Vervier, a deep exasperation
thrilling in her voice. “And even if she did
not love him, she cares quite enough. He is an admirable
<span class='it'>parti</span>, this Jerry; I could not have chosen better
had I been free to choose; he is an admirable <span class='it'>parti</span> and
can give her all that I cannot give; security, position,
wealth. Such a marriage would atone for everything
that my darling has lacked. And love would come;
why should it not? It is, as you say, her pride only
that stands in the way. Ah, if she would only trust me!”
madame Vervier’s voice for the first time trembled,
and looking up at her he saw tears in her eyes—“If
she would only trust me! I could arrange it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not put before her the old, romantic protests.
They had ceased to have validity for himself.
All that madame Vervier said was true; truer far than
she could know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Better, far better, that Alix should marry Jerry, not
loving him, than be exposed to the perils of her life in
France. She had loved him once; why not again? She
was a child. She could not know her own heart. Her
pride had had a dreadful blow; and she had come too
near the fire; that was all. She must trust them; it was
true. She must trust him and her mother. To this
strange pass had France brought Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come over to try to help you, you know,” he
said. “I want it as much, I believe, as you want it.
About her pride—Lady Mary, I’m sure, expects them
to marry now.—She shall hear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I felt that you had come to give me hope,
Giles,” madame Vervier breathed, and her hand, for a
moment, rested on his shoulder. “You are wonderful.
You are <span class='it'>impayable</span>.—No one would believe in you.—If
anyone can help, it is you. Alix will listen to you
when she will listen to no one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe she will. I’ll do my best,” Giles muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, as he looked down at the grass, sitting there
filially at madame Vervier’s feet, he knew that his
heart was torn in two and that he longed to put his
head down on her knees and tell her that no one in the
world would ever love Alix as he himself did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Giles came down to breakfast next morning,
Alix was already there, setting a bowl of nasturtiums
on the blue-and-white cloth. He had not had a word
with her last night when a sudden fall of rain had kept
them all in the drawing-room, and he seized his opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you have a long walk with me this morning,
Alix?” he said. “A really long one, you know. I want
to go to Allongeville and see the church again; and
then, oh, a long way further. Along the cliffs for ever
so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at her flowers, drawing a leaf forward
here and there around the edge of the bowl, and he saw
that she was troubled. But she said: “We will go to
the church, at all events. Yes. I should like a walk
very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>André entered as she spoke the words and she went
on quietly, giving Giles a suffocating sense of the imminence
of peril from her very readiness, her very calm:
“Do you not think nasturtiums very charming flowers,
Giles? No one ever speaks of them;—yet they are
charming. The leaves; the colour. I like them, and
yet I do not love them. Why is it? There are no yellow
flowers of Summer that one can love. The yellow
of Spring is so different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One doesn’t love any of the things of Summer as
one does the things of Spring,” André remarked,
strolling to the window to look out, and, clearly this
morning, Giles divined what he had only surmised
yesterday, that his temper was not attuned to brightness;
that there might even lurk beneath its graceful
surface a vindictive watchfulness. And when he had
spoken he turned, leaning against the window, and
looked at Alix, poised in her whiteness above the bowl
of glowing flowers, looked at her as Giles had never
before seen him look; as if with resentment that she
should be so beautiful; as if with a challenge to her to
deny his right to find her so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but that is not so,” said Alix. “One loves
roses—especially white roses;—and carnations; and
jasmine; nothing in Spring is more lovely than jasmine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would give them all for a handful of primroses,”
said André, his eyes fixed on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you?” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nothing; it was everything. It revealed
nothing, yet it might conceal anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: I would, mademoiselle Alix,” said André,
laughing a little as he stood, leaning, his arms folded,
against the window. “Indeed, I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles, watching the confrontation, sick with dread
and fury, knew himself as much baffled as André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix showed nothing to him, too; or she showed
everything. Just as one chose to take it. “Here is our
coffee,” she said. “And here is Maman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lovely in her white, the white rose, the jasmine,
madame Vervier bent her forehead to Alix’s kiss and
something in the daughter’s eyes made Giles think of a
sword in the hand of an avenging, or protecting, angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>André bowed over his hostess’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles and I are to have a long walk, Maman,” said
Alix, going to her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be caught in the rain,” said André. “Have
you noticed the sky? It is threatening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But see the sunlight,” said madame Vervier, pouring
out the coffee. “It will be a beautiful morning
of great clouds and sunlight. There is nothing I love
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will perhaps have a long drive with me,
<span class='it'>chère</span> madame,” said André.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Robert may come, too. I do not like to leave
him behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How easy she made it for André to pretend that the
relinquishment of the <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> was a favour he granted
her with difficulty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But certainly.—Since you ask it! Certainly he
must come.—Does he still suffer this morning with
his head, do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear so. Albertine has taken him his breakfast to
his room. That is a bad sign. A drive will do him
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not like being rained on, you know,” André
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so glad that he was not to be alone with madame
Vervier that he dared thus embroider his feint of
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can shelter him,” said madame Vervier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While Giles converts mademoiselle Alix to the
methods of the British Empire,” said André, sitting
with his back to the window where the sunlight fell
about him and buttering his roll with a curious light
crispness of touch, as if he were painting a picture.
There was something in the play of the long, fine hands
with the bread that Giles was never to forget; something
cruel, controlled. He read in the young Frenchman’s
face the signs of an exasperation mastered with
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the method of the British Empire is unconscious,”
said madame Vervier. “It seeks no
converts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a little jealous of Giles, you know, mademoiselle
Alix,” smiled André, just raising his eyes to
hers. “As a Frenchman, I am jealous of his unconscious
proselytizing. Once or twice yesterday I was
afraid for France. Do not forget, when you listen to
him, that our French roots are the most tenacious in
the world. Perhaps that is why we do not found empires.
Sever us from our soil and we bleed to death—or
else, a worse destiny, wither. Do not forget that
the unconscious is crafty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix, opposite her mother, sat silent. Whether, in
her mother’s presence, she had lost her readiness Giles
could not divine. But she made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix has learned in England to be dispassionate,”
said madame Vervier, her lovely russet head a little
bent downward. “She has learned to combine love for
another country with loyalty to her own. That is
something England has given her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—but that’s impossible;—impossible, for our
French hearts, you know!” laughed André. “We are
not dispassionate. To be dispassionate is to be tepid,
sleepy, indifferent;—to be withering, in fact. No, no,
no, if mademoiselle Alix transferred her love, it would
be to transfer her loyalty also. It is for that that I beg
her to stand firm;—to remember that England can
never give her what France can give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Encore du café, Maman, s’il vous plaît</span>,” said Alix.
She passed her cup to her mother. She did not look at
André at all. Her voice, for all its disconcerting matter-of-fact,
conveyed no provocation. But, glancing over
at André, Giles saw that he suddenly blushed hotly,
and then, as she took Alix’s cup and poured out the
milk and coffee, that a deep colour mounted also to
madame Vervier’s brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes. It would probably rain, thought Giles. He
waited for Alix on the cliff. It was a sunny, yet tumultuous
and menacing day. Great clouds piled themselves
along the horizon; the sails of the fishing boats
were bent sideways as they went, on a ruffled sea, before
the wind. “Yes. Rain is coming,” he muttered to
himself, though he was not thinking of the weather.
They had all parted in silence at the breakfast-table.
Even madame Vervier had found no words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly André came down the steps of Les Chardonnerets.
He had his cigarette and an odd bright
smile was on his lips; yet as he approached he reminded
Giles of the sails on the sea. André might still
try to keep up appearances; but the wind was blowing
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was not going to keep up appearances. “So,”
he said, “to-day is a day of destiny. You are not at all
unconscious, are you, Giles? You have come to plead
the cause of your laggard young friend the Englishman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, was the thought that went through Giles, let
him have it, then. “Why do you call him laggard?” he
inquired, and he knew that the anger that boiled up
in his breast was so violent that he could have struck
André as he stood there. “Would you be eager to take
into your family a young girl placed as Alix is placed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>André became very pale, but his eyes lighted. His
sail scooped the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you plead my cause with her if I say that I
would?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles stood there, still; rooted to the ground. André
had not meant to say that. Something in his own look
had made him say it. It was the blow returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think of marrying Alix?” said Giles in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” André replied. “I think of it; now. It is my
way out. Why should I retire when there is that way?
Little as you could imagine it, I care for her enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Care for her enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you like to put it so. You see where I stand.
Don’t keep up pretences,” said André. “It’s come on
slowly;—but it has me now and there is no escape.—<span class='it'>Elle
est dans mon sang.</span>—My family would have to
submit;—and her mother’s consent I could gain;—to
marriage.—Why do you look at me with that face?
She does not love your Jerry. And in marrying me she
would marry a man whose devotion to her mother
would never waver. Don’t imagine,” said André, eyeing
his friend, “that my devotion to Alix’s mother has
wavered. It is altered; yes; that is inevitable; we have
no power over these changes. But she will always remain
for me the most generous, most admirable of
women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t see the hideousness of what you propose?”
Giles felt his foundations tottering beneath
him. André’s aspect, bright and baleful, seemed to
tower above him like one of the darkly radiant clouds
in the sky. And it was a thunderbolt he had launched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deplore a marked awkwardness,” he said. “Especially
since Alix, I fear, has become aware of it.
Your English plan of destroying the innocence of
young girls has grave disadvantages. You will own
that. But, in any case, hideousness is not a word I
could connect with any project of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll never take you! Never!” Giles cried. He
felt himself trembling with the fury of his repudiation.
“I can tell you that now. She would feel it as I do.
She would see it as hideous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what she would see; nor do I,”
said André. “She thinks she hates me. You needn’t
tell me that. But I am not ignorant in women’s hearts.
Hate may be the best of beginnings. The struggle may
be a little longer;—I like struggles, let me tell you;
the longer they last the sweeter is the surrender at the
end.—And I have every reason to believe that to begin
with hate is often to end with a more complete
surrender.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As André gave him this information Giles saw Alix
emerge upon the verandah of Les Chardonnerets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not hear their voices, but their confrontation
she must remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing Giles’s eyes fixed, André turned his head and
looked for a moment, also. Then he glanced back at
Giles. “Plead your Jerry’s cause,” he said. “<span class='it'>Je vous
cède le pas.</span>” He turned on his heel. “If you fail, I
shall plead mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giles was aware, as Alix approached him, that he
must seem to stare stupidly. “I could gain her
mother’s consent.” Of all the brazen words that
André had uttered, it was these that rang most brazenly
in his ear. Was it true? Was it possible? If Alix
already loved him? Could he be sure of his Alix were
the hideous complicity of events thus to disclose itself?
He could have fallen at her feet, in tears, clasping her
and supplicating her not to be abased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as she approached him, silent, he muttered a
trivial word and they turned to walk along the cliff-path,
while the clouds piled themselves higher in the blue sky
and the wind blew yet more strongly from the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix did not say a word. She held her soft hat at
her side and the wind blew back her hair. Over her
white dress a long white woollen cloak was knotted at
her throat, and it, too, blew back from her as she
walked. She looked before her with the high, majestic
look he had already noted on her face in moments
of great emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alix,” said Giles in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had gone for a long way in silence. The sea
now was green beneath them. The sky was a wild grey
and all the grass silver as the wind blew it towards their
feet. He did not know what he was going to say. He
did not look at her. But he saw that she turned her
face towards him. A clue then came. “Alix, do you
remember, long ago, you promised me that you would
never tell me a lie?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not unclosing her lips she nodded. He had glanced
at her and met her eyes, but he could not read her look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well”—he heard that his voice trembled and he
was suddenly afraid that he should not get far without
crying—“Jerry, before I left Oxford, showed me a
letter he had from you. It troubled him; badly; but he
couldn’t know how it troubled me. You said you could
never marry him because you now loved someone else.
Was that true, Alix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away her head and looked before her; and
again she did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please tell me. Was it true? Do you love someone
else, Alix?” Giles pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was terribly pale. Did she expect him not to
have heard? Not to ask, since he knew? “Please,
Alix,” he repeated; and then, once more, she bowed
her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well”—Giles did not know how he forced his
voice along—“One more question. Will you tell me
this—Is it André de Valenbois?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Giles!” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped short there in the wind, turned to him.
The wind blew her hair across her face and mechanically
she put up her hand and pushed it back while she
gazed at him. “Oh, Giles!” she repeated, putting back
the short tresses that whipped across her eyes and lips.
“Can you ask me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was like a beacon set against the storm,
high in the sky. In its light he read all the monstrousness
of what he had asked, and her hand, still holding
back her hair, seemed to clear it for him so that he
could receive the full illumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he read her look and saw the tears that suddenly
welled up into her eyes, Giles, with an overwhelming
lift of the heart, felt himself sobbing. “Forgive me!
Forgive me, darling.—It was all that I could think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor Giles,” she said brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking on, quickly now. Somewhere,
near by, Giles was conscious of a great brightness approaching
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was horribly afraid. I could think of nobody else.
And he loves you;—you see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it.—Yes.—You have suffered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And though it seemed to me that you hated him;—it
might not have prevented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not let us speak of it.—And she has suffered.
You would think, would you not, that I would hate
him more for what he has made her suffer.” Alix
spoke with difficulty, in short breaths; and though
the wind blew her hair backward, now that they again
were breasting it, she still kept her hand up against her
face, looking before her as she tried to tell him her
difficult thoughts.—“Yet it is not so. It is not so,”
she repeated. “I feel as if I understood it all.—It is
so strange, Giles, all that I have had to understand in
these last months. I seem to understand people like
him and Maman.—They are helpless, Giles. They
are like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my darling!” said Giles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on side by side. The rain had begun to
fall in great drops. On their tip of promontory they
seemed poised between sky and sea, the marshalled
chaos—above, below. And the brightness was spreading
in Giles’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is Allongeville,” said Alix. The town lay
beneath them, half obliterated with the rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us run,” said Giles. “We can go into a shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or into the church,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put out his hand for hers and they started to
run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could have sung with exultation. Not only
André’s sinister shadow was gone; but that tumult in
himself. He was a boy again, and Alix, his child, his
darling, was beside him. They ran, with deep breaths,
smiling round at each other. The long wooded <span class='it'>allées</span>
of the town stretched nearly to the cliff-top, and once
beneath a steep, green tunnel there was no need to go
so fast, for they hardly felt the rain, so dense was the
roof of green; only heard it pattering heavily on the
leaves above their heads. But, still running, they
reached the emptied <span class='it'>place</span>, its cobblestones glistening
with the wet, and as they passed Giles saw an astonished
face at the toy-shop door, where stout madame
Bonnefoix stood looking out between bunches of
spades and buckets, string bags full of brightly coloured
balls and festoons of dolls in stiff muslin chemises.
The peaceful sculptured porch of the church was before
them, and it seemed to Giles that it had been waiting
for them—for centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they entered, they found the church, with its
whitewashed walls and innocently bedizened saints,
light and smiling after the darkened day outside. A
smell of incense, flowers, and cobwebs was in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix paused to cross herself with holy water from the
<span class='it'>bénitier</span> carved into the stone of a pillar and bent her
knee before the High Altar as they crossed the nave,
while Giles held his Protestant head bashfully high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down on a bench far back in an aisle
and smiled, tremulously, at each other. They were so
much more alone than on the cliff with the rain and
sea. No one was in the church; no one was in the <span class='it'>place</span>
outside. It was very still, and the sound of the rain
falling straightly and steadily outside made the stillness
more manifest. The wind had already dropped.
It was a summer rain, now, full of sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May we talk in church?” Giles whispered. He
looked away from Alix at the remembered statue of the
Virgin, all white and blue, with pots of pink hydrangeas
at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we may,” Alix said. “We disturb no one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your saints won’t mind, will they?” Giles could
not keep the tremor from his voice. “Such a good
Catholic as you are, Alix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think my saints are pleased,” Alix’s voice, too,
trembled; though she was not as shy as he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, Toppie has gone into her convent,”
Giles said, gazing at the Virgin, whose uplifted, blessing
hands brought the image of Toppie so vividly before
him. It was as if Toppie herself stood there, smiling
down upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother wrote of it,” said Alix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met again in Oxford, only a little while ago,” said
Giles. “She saw something that everybody has been
seeing; even Jerry saw it.—You know, Alix, I love
Toppie as much as ever; yet I’m so changed. It’s all so
different. Can you understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never dreamed you could be different about Toppie,”
Alix murmured after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that why you thought I’d never guess, even
if I saw your letter to Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not think you would ever guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t. I never dreamed there was a chance for
me; never dreamed it.—That’s what I told them all;—that
there wasn’t a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix, too, had been gazing before her, sitting there
beside him in her wet white cloak; but as he said this
she leaned forward and put her hands up to her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, darling, are you crying?” Giles’s arms were
round her as he asked it. “Have I been so stupid?—Is
it really me you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever since that day I came to you from Toppie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was crying; but it was in his arms and his cheek
was against her dear wet head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy;—Happy;—Happy”—were the only
words in Giles’s mind and they went on and on like a
song while he heard the rain falling sweetly and the
brightness was all about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened to the rain for a long time, but when he
spoke it was to answer her last words.—“It’s been
since then with me, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alix’s head lay against his shoulder and he held both
her hands in his against his breast; and he was seeing
the little French girl, the strange, ominous little French
girl, sitting in the Victoria waiting-room with her
straight black brows and her eyes calm over their fear.
He was seeing the lovely dancing head bound with
crystal, aware of him, looking for him even in her joy;
he was seeing the Alix who had come from Toppie.
“We’ve always been so near, from the first, haven’t
we?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So near, Giles. That was what troubled me, though
I did not understand, when Jerry asked me to marry
him.—You were so much nearer than Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who did you think I should believe it to be,
darling, when I saw the letter to Jerry?—Didn’t you
know I’d have to ask you some time? Did you really
believe, when we were so near as that, you could hide
it from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I could. I had to stop Jerry from coming.
I could have pretended that there was someone
you didn’t know.—Someone who might not love me,
but whom I should always love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You who promised never to tell me a lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for those things women must always lie, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her head now to look at him. Her face
was radiant yet grave. “There will never be anything
to hide any more;—never—never.—There
is nothing you do not understand. You understand
all my life. You understand Maman.—Giles, how
happy this will make her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it will. But I came to plead Jerry’s cause,
you know. She thinks I’m pleading it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How happy it will make her that you did not have
to plead it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it? I can’t help being afraid that she’ll be
disappointed. She’d have preferred the better match
for you, darling little Alix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will not think it better. It was all she had left
to hope for, that was all. It has wounded her pride
horribly to have to hope for it—after the bitter things
it has meant for her and for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—if you could have cared.—Everything
would have come right. Lady Mary is so fond of you
and she would have stood by. Darling, it isn’t only
loving;—no one knows that better than you do;—it’s
living. Do you face it all? To live in Oxford? To
be the wife of a humdrum scholar? To have no balls
and no riding? To wear”—Giles found—“the
wrong sort of clothes and think about ordering breakfast.
Darling, Jerry loves you, you know, and the
bitter things would all fade away. Such a different life
is there for you to take. I can’t help seeing, though we
love each other, that it’s the life you were meant for
and that the life with me in Oxford isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, Giles, you do not see that,” said Alix. She
put her hand on his shoulder, as if with its pressure to
help him to think clearly. “You are English and believe
that more than anything it is right to marry the
person you love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are French, Alix. It’s the other belief
that’s in your blood. The belief in what’s suitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but it is true what Maman says to me, when
she reproaches me; I have in some things become English.
I think the thing most suitable of all is to love
one’s husband. To marry Jerry, loving you;—no,
Giles; you know that that would not be possible to me.
And I do not love him at all. He is not near me at all;
while you are like a part of my life.—No, listen to
me, dear Giles.—This is not making love. It is being
French; it is being reasonable. Even the clothes and
the breakfasts;—oh, I know that they are important.—But
I am used to being poor and to knowing how to
be right with very little money.—In clothes and in
breakfasts, Giles, I shall know how to be right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes, resting on him, were the eyes of the English
Alix, of the woman who chooses, for herself, her
life and the man she will share it with; yet their look
was a French look, too. The look of one who has no
illusions; who sees an order and accepts it; an order to
live for and to make one’s own. “And there will be the
ideas and the atoms to watch, and the Bach choir to
sing in,” she finished; “and walks in the country;—and
then I shall be in France, for all the holidays,
with Maman, Giles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose as she spoke, for the storm had passed.
Sunlight was flooding in through the high pale windows
of the clerestory. The Virgin’s crown glittered
against her pillar. Slowly, hand in hand, Alix and
Giles walked down the nave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was something more he had to say to her,
here, in her France, in her church, beneath her Virgin’s
blessing hands. This woman Alix had made none of the
conditions that the child Alix, bewildered, charmed,
afraid, had asked of her first lover. She asked no
promises. She left everything to him. It was his order
she accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And before they turned aside to go, Giles paused and
took both her hands in his. It was at the feet of the
dear, silly Virgin in her white and blue and gold that he
made his promise: “Darling, you shall lose nothing,
nothing that I can help. It will never be alone that
you’ll come for those holidays. If you take England
for me, you must give me all that you can of France.—Everything
that is sacred to you, is sacred to me,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they opened the door the world was dazzling
with sunlight and a great white cloud towered up like
an august and welcoming angel in the sky, while across
the <span class='it'>place</span> the little Curé came hurrying, stout and
active with his rosy, peasant face and thick grey hair.
He looked at them kindly, if very shyly, murmuring a
word of greeting to Alix as they all met in the porch,
and Giles, in deference to convention, dropped the
hand he held. But Alix, as she smiled at the Curé
and smiled beyond him at all the sunlit world she was
entering, took Giles’s hand in hers again, and said:
“Monsieur le Curé, may I present to you my <span class='it'>fiancé</span>?”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
